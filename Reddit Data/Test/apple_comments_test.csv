"I think they're going as far as killing the standalone player. It's not just the plugin in-browser... permanently de-licensing and disabling THAT would pass without comment from me. 

I've never heard of another software publisher handling a software package EOL this way. They all have the same issues... particularly Microsoft and Apple. 

I don't take issue with the notice period; I do take issue with what they're doing as part of the EOL. And they could have opened the format before EOL, or even now, to at least assist the idea that other publishers could have made a sandboxed standalone player.

&gt; In April 2010, Apple&amp;#039;s Steve Jobs wrote a blistering open letter headlined Thoughts On Flash, in which he laid out why Apple would not let Flash run on iPhones and iPads.

&gt; Big brands such as Facebook, Netflix and YouTube were already streaming videos to smartphones without Flash and in November 2011 Adobe ended development of Flash for mobile devices.

&gt; Since Adobe will prevent Flash Player from displaying content from 12 January, there are concerns that years of animations, games and interactive websites will be lost.

Meanwhile Apple has by the far the highest margins in the industry and thus the most ability to do something meaningful like is done in other types of industry like agriculture where they have fair trade policies, etc.

Tim Cook should go, but he won't because this is the plan, not a defect of it. He was the one who oversaw Apple's move to China. A lot of people don't know Apple made its Macs in California--even after Steve Jobs came back, some of the first iMacs were made in CA. I am sure this move to China is exactly what Steve Jobs wanted.

 Yes, the system is set up to maximize profits - but that just means you need a counter-balancing system that provides different incentives.  Such as government regulation.  It would not be perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it is better than nothing.

As a result, for every Windows release, MS comes out with special versions of Windows that comply with the laws - at great expense and effort.  The point is that large enough fines can and do regulate behavior.

If they all use child labour, then it’s still bad. I’m sure you agree with this. Apple is probably being spoken about as that’s what the article is concerning.

One example here. Apple ranked as the “top” company with regard to supply chain. These ghouls pretend that they care about the world, because they talk about sustainability etc, but they don’t bother to do the main thing that would help these countries.

They’re the big boys, that’s why they get hit a lot on this stuff. For all their guff about sustainability and climate change, they do very little help the countries that make their products.

What is the ultimate goal of a company in your mind?

You send in inspectors and define the areas that you wish to mine, and what impact that is going to have on the wider region.

&gt;	or they understand when inspectors come so they just avoid child labour on those days.

These children will be in school, which attendance can easily be monitored. Output / jobs can also be monitored. If they’re not providing you with verifiable data on who has worked what and when, then you don’t work with them.

What about their profits? Apple will pay a fair price for the minerals, as well as providing schooling for children. Where do you see the loss of profit here?

&gt;	You cay they need X amount, what if they need children to get to X amount? 

So children are required for a given level of productivity? You’re telling me that in a country of 50 million poor adults, you couldn’t find enough of them to do the work?

"&gt; capitalism is human nature

Obviously some elements of human nature are evidenced in the structure of capitalism—because humans made it—but to say that private ownership of the means of production *is* human nature is silly. 

I'm not even quite sure what it means to say a given economic system ""is human nature"" because plenty of other economic systems have existed... were those systems all **also** human nature? I mean, it's quite clear that common ownership is the default position of groups of pre-agricultural humans; and that, for example, commonly-owned pastures were a major part of post-agricultural human development. So why now, all of a sudden, is complete private ownership the only possible economic system under which humans can live? It just makes no sense.

&gt; Let's say that Apple gets fined a billion for every month of using the supplier after being notified of the problem.  What do you think they would do then? 

Probably use its massive amount of accumulated capital to lobby legislators into changing the laws. I mean, there's a reason that the law doesn't exist: it doesn't serve the interests of private capital. Laws that don't serve those interests don't get made, and if they do its only because of massive, sustained public pressure campaigns. Which are quite rare, obviously, for two major reasons: (1) because maintaining constant pressure on governance requires no faltering; if the public pressure falters for even a moment, private capital will take advantage and codify its interests via the state, and (2) because we, the proletariat, are all more focused on keeping rooves over our heads and food on our tables by selling our labor-time. 


I think you'd find the book ""Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution
Book"" by Peter Kropotkin a good read. The book's primary aim is to challenge the way we think about human nature, and how we've come to be taught about evolution in a backwards way... It's not human nature to be in constant competition with one another, or accumulate private control of resources; it is human nature to work together, to aid each other, and be in solidarity with each other through mutual understanding and common goals. Kropotkin shows us that the only species that survive are those which engage in mutual aid. Also just a fun read.

"Not really. I’m just holding companies to a higher standard than you are. Sorry that I believe they shouldn’t be allowed to ransack third world countries because to not do so “would be too hard”.

&gt;	If you want to shoot down my hypothetical examples; we could literally do this all day. My point is not to prove that they are impossible to overcome, just that there is an infinite number of ways to circumvent regulations and rules.

Your point was to provide an endless stream of easy to think of arguments that will justify your stance. I responded to each because they’re all paper thin. If you want to discuss the issue then do so instead of throwing wafer thin arguments around.

Of course there are ways to get around these things, because that’s how our system is set up. There is almost zero accountability for large multinationals operating outside of their head quartered nation.

Do you not find it abhorrent that Apple can literally support child slavery, and people like yourself just shrug and say “well it’s hard to not do it”?

What a failure of imagination.

&gt;	sorry, I wanted to add some more.

You just said above that I could shoot down your examples and we could do this all
day. You’re obviously incapable of imagining a world that doesn’t allow companies to support the exploitation of children, but I’ll
go ahead and address your points anyway.

&gt;	Is it apples job to play human rights officer? 

Of course not.

&gt;	Or is that the governments job?

Which government? The US, or the Congo?

Imagine if the US wrote a law that levied hefty punishments on any US company using child labour in its supply chain. I wonder if that would help? No, couldn’t do that could we, it’s just too hard!

&gt;	Think of the infrastructure required on apple’s end to have “sustainable and humane” production. Let me use an analogy for your own life - maybe it will relate. Do you tour the factories you buy your clothes in? No? You really should. Your brand is in part your clothes. Do you “monitor the internet” perhaps, but that may not necessarily be the truth of what is going on. What about all of your technology, or your car, or your kitchen supplies? You should monitor those too to make sure everyone is playing by the rules. See how quickly this gets absurd?

This is a producer side issue.

And yes, I actually do try my best to monitor where I get things from and to ensure that people aren’t getting fucked over so I can live my life.

My clothing is (mostly) handmade from local U.K. shops. A lot of it is made out of hemp grown in the US on union farms. Not perfect no doubt, but better than most clothing that’s for sure!

Do I monitor the internet? I don’t even know what this point means. Should I not use the internet because it’s also used for child exploitation? Cars are used to run people over but that doesn’t mean I can’t get on a bus.

I don’t own a car luckily!

But yes you’re right, opaque supply chains make it very difficult for consumers to adequately decide on whether or not a given purchase is ethical or not.

With the added effects of globalisation, even if I wanted to get (let’s say) a plastic spatula made in the U.K., I don’t think I’d be able to. It’s all China baby!

However, just because you disagree with a system that you’re forced to live in, doesn’t mean you can’t 1) complain about said system, and 2) try to work to change it. Insert “we should improve society somewhat” meme here.

I will ask, I wonder what would happen if western governments started policing this supply chain madness. What would happen?",1609516513.0,1

"I feel arguing about concepts I.e blue can’t be red conceptually is regressive because conception is also not universal. Like an orange and can’t of course ever be an Apple. But to say a someone educated differently, he might call an Apple an orange or an orange an Apple. What we name it is irrelevant, you can only agree on what something is when you describe its properties, and the fact that wavelength is not an inherent property of light, it varies by observer, to me immediately makes me question *everything* about reality. Including irreversibility of entropy. It’s similar to the question of universal constants. Why are they what they are? Why is entropy irreversible? In order for us to make sense of the universe, we seek to anchor ourselves somewhere, to some thing that we *know* is true regardless of who, what, where, when you are. Speed of light is one such thing. Entropy is another. That still seems arbitrary, almost too good to be true, that we found something to hang our hats on. Considering that we clearly, on the grand scale of things, only pretend to understand the universe, and that too very very very little of it, it seems almost presumptuous that we have already arrived on some universal truths, doesn’t it? Unless of course, we haven’t, and they are just a stand in for now, helping us make sense of things the best we can.

I realise that this isn’t a very practical or even useful discussion because my argument simply boils down to “nothing is real”. But it’s just worth thinking about for those who care to, that we know things only in hindsight. If we haven’t come close to finding a way to reverse entropy, maybe it’s just because we haven’t yet. We didn’t come close to heavier than air flight, until we figured it out.

In my mind entropy is similar to the concept of god. It’s something we choose to believe because it gives us something to build our house on. In contrast to your own words, I fee entropy itself is far, far too good of a thing.",1609615911.0,1

"That’s not the main reason for turnover as turnover is quite high in most tech and often people even return to the same company years later.

Tenure is pretty bad across most tech companies even ones with very strong employee reviews because of how valuable job hopping is. Amazon is disliked enough that people also likely leave because of work experience, but I don’t think google has that issue at all.

"That illustrates my point though, Europe's tech industry isn't really competitive compared to the US. Spotify and Skype are great examples of household names, but I wouldn't call them powerhouses, they have both been replicated several times over by bigger competitors. I wouldn't consider Siemens or Bosch to be tech companies, in the same way I don't really think GE or Honeywell really qualify. SAP, Ericsson, Nokia? Granted those are indeed tech companies, but I would put them in the same category as IBM and Motorola i.e. mature institutions which aren't really driving the forefront of innovation. Rovio, Mojang, King, CD Projekt Red, etc... game publishers are fair examples of tech companies, but again I think they are just as much art/entertainment as they are tech and they aren't really on the bleeding edge of developing anything futuristic.

&gt; Nothing about unions prevents innovation. I'd almost say it's the opposite, as a safety net for employees means that it's easier to take risk and work for a start-up since if the company were to go under you'll not lose any pay, you'll have unemployment covered and the union will help you find a new job as well.

The proof is in the pudding. There is a reason why there aren't European equivalents to Apple, Google, Amazon, Tesla, Space X, Nvidia, etc... If we look at the [top 20 global tech companies by market cap](https://companiesmarketcap.com/tech/largest-tech-companies-by-market-cap/), there is an approximate value of $12.48 trillion in total. Of that $12.48T, US companies make up $9.77T where European companies make up $0.364T. To frame it in a positive light for Europeans, I will say that you clearly optimize for the welfare of your citizenry, but in doing so you are making a tradeoff that comes at the expense of innovation.

A friend of mine works for an equally non-essential luxury goods retailer. They don't have a click and collect option on their website (they're quite a small chain) so they've been working by phone. The website directs customers to call the stores, the staff deal with the customer like normal but by phone and the customer goes to collect. 

If Apple are fully closing their stores then it's because they've chosen to - which is a good thing (provided their staff are at least being furloughed).

My friend still has to go to the shop so customers can collect the things they order.

Google knows everything about me by now most likely and  I hate it. The damage is done.

If the product is free, you are the product. Fucking sucks to not have money and chose different options.

Always have been an apple user for mobiles, Windows for PC, Playstation for gaming.

Yes, they all collect Data, Bit they all are different Parties, none of them knows everything.

First my mobile died and I moved to Android because I had no money for a new iPhone, then my ps4 dies and I moved to stadiA, when I bought cyberpunk I did get a free Chromecast so I currently have linked my Amazon Prime with the ccu, Spotify with the ccu and do my gaming through the ccu or PC.

Google knows when I get Up, where and when I have appointments, when I or watch movies, when I Game, whAt Games and for how Long, they know when I Go to bed. They know who s sending me E-Mails and what I search in the web. They know where I Go.


I actually have Changed my search engine to duckduckgo but the search Resultat in Germany really are Not that convincing Most Times, so I use Google again anyways.

If I Had the money I would Chose Playstation again for gaming.

If I Had the money I would get a Second PC and learn Linux.

If I Had the money, I wod get an iPhone again.

I don't have the Money so basically everything i currently do online in some way is running through/ via Google.

"“Apple’s board of directors regularly discusses antitrust risks, the company said on Tuesday in an annual filing.

The language, which is new in this year’s proxy statement, highlights how regulatory pressure and antitrust issues have become a significant risk for Apple as policymakers increasingly scrutinize big technology companies.

Apple doesn’t have the same antitrust issues that rival companies such as Facebook and Google have, but Apple CEO Tim Cook testified alongside their CEOs in front of Congress last summer about antitrust topics. Cook later said he wanted to “unpeel” Apple from the investigation.

The new passage reads as follows:

“The Audit Committee and Board regularly review and discuss with management Apple’s antitrust risks. Apple’s Antitrust Compliance Officer is responsible for the development, review, and execution of Apple’s Antitrust Compliance Program and regularly reports to the Audit Committee. These reports cover, among other matters, the alignment of the program with Apple’s potential antitrust risks, and the effectiveness of the program’s design in detecting and preventing antitrust issues and promoting compliance with laws and Apple policies.””",1609894259.0,-1

&gt; Apple doesn&amp;#039;t have the same antitrust issues that rival companies like Facebook and Google have, but Apple CEO Tim Cook testified alongside their CEOs in front of Congress last summer about antitrust topics.

&gt; Apple&amp;#039;s antitrust problems mostly relate to its control of the App Store, the only way to install software on an iPhone, which competitors and app makers say costs too much and limits competition.

&gt; Apple also faces inquiries from international regulators, including the EU. The details about Apple&amp;#039;s antitrust compliance program comes in the middle of an expanded section about which parts of Apple the audit committee oversees, including data security, business conduct, and taxes.

"&gt; The issue with software is that, unlike an appliance, you don't ""own"" the things it's made out of. If I buy a blender, and scrap it to make other shit and sell that, it's my blender so I can do it. But with software, buying a license to use it doesn't mean I have the rights to the code. I can't buy a copy of photoshop, and then piecemeal the code into my own app to sell. The terms and conditions also deal with a lot of how the software can be distributed since, unlike my old example blender, it can be infinitely replicated and shared.

When I buy a book I  theoretically can copy parts of it and sell it as my own. but we have a set of laws (is it copyright laws?) that guides conduct in that scenario (even if those laws are problematic in their own right). The point is all of this is achieved without me having to sign a contract anytime I buy a book. This is because we have developed some standard rules for those kinds of transactions.

&gt;The rest of the stuff in the terms and conditions is usually just defining the service being provided and how it will be paid for and provided, which happens in basically every service contract, though frequently it is done verbally for small shit. 

The vast majority of financial transactions are not made with a contract.  When I buy an apple or a guitar lesson, I don't sign a contract. We all know that not meeting the basic standard expectation in those scenarios will result in the court intervening in a predictable manner. I know that if the apple is poisoned I could sue the grocery store and would win, so we don't need a contract to define liabilities. 

contracts should be used for especially esoteric or important transactions, where the transaction is too infrequent for the court to establish a standard or when the sides have the financial incentive and capabilities to hire lawyers.  

&gt;I'd love it if we could just accept not trying to find ways to be intentionally dense about all this and the T&amp;C didn't need to be as long, but in my experience, way too many people have zero fucking idea about any of the stuff, and just assume it's always exactly as they want it to be, not what it is. And as this suit shows, we have apparently accepted ignorance as a defense. Having bulletproof wording is even more important now

To the contrary, it is a case of the courts saying ""I don't care if the TOS of the grocery store specify you're not liable to health problem, you just can't go around selling poisoned apples"". A contract was never intended to be a license to do whatever you want.",1609924876.0,-1

"I agree to an extent, but suppose we accept the definition of “value” as purely the value of economic production. I have two completely separate things to say about this.

1) Elon Musk doesn’t have an ACTUAL value of $185,000,000,000, he has an ESTIMATED value of $185,000,000,000. The Tesla bubble (may or may not be so) could pop. It turns out the market WAY overestimated how much Elon is worth. Worse, Elon could cash out on all of his positions before the pop, and the fallout would instead fall on all other owners of Tesla. 

2) Many execs doom their companies by accepting economic production as “value”. R&amp;D sinks money (until it finds gold) and marketing makes money.

"I viewed Tesla as a yolo and a meme stock all the way back in 2017, the price then was $68.

Now, I believe Tesla will get a higher valuation than Apple (over three times its current price). Here's why:

- Many people still view Tesla just as a car company, that's the biggest mistake many people who view it tend to commit. It's not just a car company, just like Apple wasn't just a computer company in the early 2000s.

- The cars Tesla sells serve as a front to a bigger goal, and that's Tesla's software. Tesla's operating system for its cars is years ahead than that of its competitors, and that's before we even factor Full Self-Driving.

- If Tesla achieves Full Self-Driving in the near future (which it is increasingly looking like it will), this becomes a game changer, and selling cars takes a back seat in the revenue machine for Tesla, as it will get in the business of selling rides and selling fleets to transportation companies or companies who need it. This will have a far greater profit margin than selling cars to private owners.

- Tesla is also selling insurance for its own cars. Every car they sell cross sales into its insurance business. Right now there's nearly 1 million costumers using Tesla's insurance. Mind you, this is not GM or Ford territory, this is State Farm territory.

- Then there's the batteries. Tesla already is using one of the most efficient batteries for EVs, now they're ramping up their production with their plants in Berlin and Texas, with the intention to sell its excess production to its own competitors, taking advantage of the current production bottleneck of batteries for EVs.

- Then there's Tesla Energy. Initially this was a trash investment and a money pit. However they have recently pivoted from trying to sell energy to homeowners, to bring a systemic solution to the grid on the energy generation and energy storage side, creating virtual power plants and massive ""batteries"". This is still taking shape, but the potential is significant, without it being a major drag on the rest of the company.

- Additionally the last two years Tesla has traded the #1 and #2 spot with SpaceX on the list of companies engineers want to work at. Why is this significant? Look backwards to this list in the previous years to see what companies topped it, and you will find there all the names of the who's who of the biggest companies by marketcap.

- More interestingly... Its costumers are in  a borderline cult. Look how well that has worked for Apple, and their shit (albeit comically expensive) didn't cost $40,000 dollars. 

3 years ago I thought that stock was just bonkers... Today... It makes total sense that it's just going to go up and up.",1610050732.0,1

Tesla was barely holding its head above water just *last year* and now with every other major automaker going all-in on electric, how are they going to maintain their marketshare?? It just seems like a balloon waiting to pop honestly.

I mean, I'll admit I was wrong to think Tesla wouldn't get this high this quick, but it's just as head scratching that it did, and typically those types of head scratching moves in the market don't necessarily end well.

"99.999999% of owners (and some non-owners) think exactly like you and would never buy another brand. Apple-like loyalty

Now, add in being the leader in autonomy (feel free to link BS articles that speak otherwise, but they are incredibly biased), along with their solar business and energy storage (new battery cells currently being produced are a breakthrough in technology), insurance, etc and you have a powerhouse company. 

The argument that most non-believers have loved to make is that they are not profitable. That WAS valid, however now they are profitable - and I believe their auto business is one of the only that is going to post a 2020 profit (if not the only one).

Now, the goalposts have moved to be ""they are not very profitable"". Well, they could be far more profitable if they weren't selling 50% more cars every year and guiding the same for the next decade at a minimum. That is absolutely insane growth, especially in such a high capex industry. We haven't seen an automotive company scale like this for a century, if ever. More importantly, being massively profitable is not aligned with their goals. Tesla's goal is and will always be to advance the world's transition to sustainable energy. As Elon has said many times, Tesla's success will be measured by how many years faster the world can make this transition with Tesla's push, relative to how many years in the absence of Tesla. How do they accomplish this? Introduce cheaper and cheaper models and cut prices of current models. More EVs on the road &gt; profits

"As someone who has now owned 4 electric cars, I would not buy a full EV that wasn't a Tesla... yet.

Charging infrastructure is like a mobile phone network. You need it to work everywhere you go. You can have the best phone, but without a data network it's useless and frustrating. Tesla is becoming Verizon. The most coverage. The other guys are just building cell phones, and not concerning themselves with networks. That is, except VW/Ford and Electrify America - but they're way behind. It's like they're installing 3G while Tesla is comfortable on LTE coverage.

I drove my Tesla 800 miles the other day. Not only was charging easy (not just many locations, and many plugs at each location, but seamlessly integrated into GPS, Nav calculations, and automatic payment - to quote apple ""it just works""). While charging at one stop with 8 Tesla chargers, I took a walk to stretch my legs over to 2 lonely CCS plugs across the lot. As I got closer I realized they were both broken, with an ""under maintenance - no data connection"" screen on each. If I was in any other model of EV and was relying on these, I'd be stuck. This isn't an isolated incident either, when I had my other EVs I'd encounter this often. The only plug in a location had a high chance of being blocked, broken or occupied.

Until manufacturers get AGGRESSIVE about charging (as in, doubling whatever Tesla is doing at the moment because they're not sleeping either) they will have a massive lead in usability, which the mainstream will demand.

"Batteries, solar panels, charging stations, insurance protection, self-driving services, and branching out from those into other areas.  

Other car manufacturers years ago realized it was more profitable to finance cars than it was to try and make a big profit selling cars.  Tesla is using a similar mindset.  Cars can make them some money, but services and related products around their cars is not just a way to get people locked into their ecosystem, but also give them revenue streams outside of car purchases.

That's why there's a lot of money in Tesla, becasue people are seeing the long term outlook there and other EVs aren't going to be able to take over that spot for them.  They are quickly becoming the Apple of the EV and renewable energy sector.",1610053525.0,1

" ""What chances do I have of investing to the point where I have billions of dollars and started from the measly 5k in my savings?""

Not billions, but literally the vast majority of Americans have the ability to retire wealthy or well off even if they’ve worked unskilled labor jobs the rest of their lives. And there are **many** examples of people who’ve done just that. Compounding returns enables a measly 5k to turn into 250k if invested in the entire US market. If you invest just $5 a day that’s enough to retire with close to a million dollars after 40 years of working.

""Take your privilege and shove it somewhere else.""

That's funny, because if you're on Reddit complaining on your iPhone/android about how bad you have it, if you have had the opportunity to go to college or train for a skilled job, or if you have the ability to access the internet from wherever you’re sitting at, if you’ve never starved a single day in your life, then you're probably more privileged than the bottom 80% of the entire globe. And all of those privileges you have is the result of our system.

Whatever system we have now, has enabled us to go from horse drawn carriages 100-150+ years ago, to self-driving cars, AI, computers that fit in our pockets and so on. 

SpaceEx has 1/100th of the budget as NASA. Yet has progressed far more in space travel than NASA has in the past 40 years. Amazon in its 25 years has progressed far more than the US postal service, has saved the average US citizen a shit load of time and money ordering and searching retail items and groceries, and they’ve even pioneered cloud computing.

CEOs like Bezos, Musk, Steve Jobs and so on simply know how to allocate capital, and hire the right skilled workers far more efficiently and effectively than the government can. You can look at the results of the USSR to see what the alternative is like. Lastly if you want to get rid of the system we have now, then people like Elon Musk, Bezos’ family, wouldn’t be migrating to the US. People wouldn’t be starting companies like Google, Apple, Tesla, Amazon in America. They’d be starting them in China instead.",1610055578.0,1

I bought them for half off but and that made helped and after having them for so long i would have paid retail for them (about $200 when they were new).

When it came time to replace them I shopped around for a new pair and found some wired bose in the same MSRP range and they were, at best, average sounding.  I have a pair of $30 skull candy in hear head phones that sounded better.  The bose just sounded flat.  So i found of sennheisers that dont feel super awesome BUT sound fucking amazing, their construction is rock solid and i am super pleased with them.  

I think Bose does well with people for what they cost because they sound better then good...unless you have used the good stuff.   most people have not.

There are also companies who at times are overvalued.  Countrywide or Enron would be examples.  These companies were profitable but their business models were not sustainable, and value wasn’t based on the business itself.

One issue I have with Tesla value supporters is they have a difficult time expressing exactly in dollars where the future value is going to be.  Tesla is an extremely valuable company, far past its current revenue or sales in and of themselves would justify.  So in order for the stock to maintain its position there needs to be a explanation of how in the near future Tesla will justify its stock price.  Otherwise it is in fact a bubble and will crash as so many bubbles have before.

"&gt;Because their labor causes their company to earn more. It's just as simple as that. You put too much on Elon Musk. The success of Tesla isn't even primarily due to him (well maybe the stock price because that shit defies all logic and will crash eventually), but it's all of the workers at Tesla. It's not as if Elon was the one doing the research, he bought the company.

This is where we diverge in thought. Their labor is not what causes the company to earn more. The absolute toughest thing in business, which is highly unpredictable, is not expending effort (labor). It is deciding where that labor is to be spent (execution and strategy). The reason companies fail is not b/c labor doesn't work hard enough - it's because management makes poor decisions. Apple in the late 90's was a failing company, near bankruptcy. When Jobs came back, he turned it from years of bleeding money to what it is now. 

Compensation is not linear. It has nothing to do with how hard you work. Obviously, Musk is not working 15,000,000 times harder than any one. For the same reason that LeBron James is not 1000x better than a G-League player. But what they both do is have impact. They are the closest thing to guaranteeing success as possible. And when success is $1T, paying $50B seems like an outright steal. I'd rather pay $50B to make a +$100B decision, than $10M to someone and have them run the company into the ground.",1610065591.0,-1

"&gt;Because without their labor the gains are not possible.

Yeah... without a lot of things gains are not possible. Without the landlord's real estate there are no offices and factories, and no gains. Without the computers that engineers code on, there are no gains. Does Tesla then need to share equity and stock with Apple, the company providing the computers, or Blackstone, the landlord of their buildings? No... because they are already paid and compensated, just like Tesla's employees.  

The people that should be compensated with stock options are the ones that are directly responsible for driving the company's success. A company's success is not predicated on laborers piecing together the product (for the same reason Nike and Apple don't give equity to its manufacturers) - the success comes from the right decisions being made. And to those who are decision makers, they are compensated with stock, and handsomely. Decisions are the sole reason a company succeeds or flounders. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Your final examples are unregulated capitalism in action, people are only paid due to the scarcity of their labor, not in proportion to it's true value (the money derived from it).

"Normally I would 100% agree with u and the solution is have platforms that are alternatives. However all of the big tech companies are essentially a monopoly atm and as we speak the recent app that was essentially a Twitter clone without restrictions is in the process of being banned by apple. 

We are basically entering new territory. And I think it's concerning because these big tech companies do have their own skin in the game and their own goals. They claim to fight for justice but for example h1b abuse is rampant if u ever worked for them or stepped inside their offices, and they probably aren't thrilled that conservatives want to reduce it. 

This is coming from someone in tech that doesn't align with either side. For the last few months I was kinda with u and agreed the solution is move to another platform but with apple recently restricting stuff on the app store and the monopoly apple and fb mainly have its concerning.

Professional political satirists and humorists are generally exempt from this requirement.”

It isn’t a contractual thing. It’s Apple trying to play both sides of the issue because they don’t want to ban a popular app and lose revenues, even if they act as if they’re opposed to the societal effects of their app.

Google has suspended Parler from the Play Store, according to a statement given to Politico reporter Cristiano Lima. New York Times reporter Jack Nicas corroborated Google’s suspension of the app.

You can read the full statement below:

Google and Parler did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Apple has given an ultimatum to Parler to police its app or be removed sometime on Saturday, BuzzFeed News reported Friday evening. The app is still available on Apple’s App Store. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Both Google and Apple have come under pressure to remove the app, which is known for having less moderation and as a conservative-friendly alternative to other social media platforms. The pressure comes two days after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, incited by President Trump.

Twitter permanently suspended Trump Friday evening, while Facebook placed an “indefinite” ban on Trump’s account on Thursday.",1610154255.0,-1
"Why do none of these companies just do the simple and obvious the right thing. Apple should immediately suspend the app, and tell them they can come back, if and when the moderation policies are suitable. Apple and the world already knows their moderation policies are unacceptable. Regardless of their intention to change it, that's how it is now, which is unsuitable for a civil society.",1610154428.0,-1

They’re under no obligation whatsoever to stock particular items. Apples stance on pornography for example, means no Onlyfans app in the AppStore. Wouldn’t be allowed. 

There is nothing to stop these people from creating newsletters, knocking on doors, organising protests, holding meetings, or shouting on street corners. But there’s also no obligation for private companies to help them if they choose not to.",1610155898.0,0
"Interesting that this will *definitely* go down in the history books, this decision made by a corporation. 

This leads to an interesting discussion, the cooperation of 4 companies can almost entirely scrub you from having an online presence. Getting booted by Apple, Google, Facebook and Twitter effectively silences you from the modern age audience. And right now, in this specific instance, most people would call this a ""good"" thing. But there is something deeply unnerving that they could do this to, let's say Biden next, because some cartoon villain Multi-Trillinaire purchased all 4 companies at once or something. 

Would we be ok with that? You say competition would solve this but running servers for social media is a huge undertaking and again, Apple and Google will shun you from the mainstream, like they're doing to Parler right now. So now you can only have people access your site via an online browser or downloading a third party app (can you even do that on Iphone?) Which *severely* hinders outreach because grandpa can barely figure out downloading Twitter.

Then again, Presidents 1-42 didn't have ""social media"" and they still got their message out. But will that old standard hold up in the new digital age?

This situation is rife with super intriguing situations and questions we'll be asking ourselves for years to come. The moves made to blackout Trump's online presence will have interesting ramifications for sure. Or maybe none, only time will tell. Stay tuned, popcorn ready.",1610155903.0,1
Apple and Google would decide what APPS can be on their store as it’s their platform. Don’t like it? Make a website and users can visit it through the browser on the phone. Really not that big of a deal.,1610155912.0,1
"People need to realize the reason Parler is banned is that they were doing nothing about people organizing multiple violent protests that were set to occur before and during Inauguration Day.

This isn't about censoring Conservative voices as much as it's about the genuine concern about the potential for loss of life in the upcoming couple of weeks.

Apple gave them 24 hours to figure it out because they have been doing nothing to moderate that dangerous rhetoric.",1610155995.0,-1
"Using privately owned infrastructure means this can happen. 

There are alternative stores like F-Droid and the ability to download APKs directly and sideload them.  The play store is not required.  

I do think apple shouldn't be allowed to require apps be installed through their store on iPhones/pads.  Allowing sideloading should be required.",1610156010.0,1
"No, they wouldn’t. The only money Apple would directly make off a from a free app is the $100/year dev license that they charge. If Parler were to have in app ads, Apple wouldn’t see a cent of that revenue.

"they aren't coordinating at all. rather, they have standards of behavior/content that they expect all apps to follow.

"Isn't it weird that everytime there are these ""purges"" against non-mainstream media sources and/or platforms, it's almost purely to the benefit of legacy platforms, and often at their behest. Half of the major YouTube changes I've read about over the years specifaclly in regards to what gets suggested in your feed and how advert money is distributed, specifically when they've made major changes at the detriments of independent creators seems to always have some driving force by traditional media behind it. CNN spends a week talking about how conspiracy videos on youtube with hundreds of millions of views are dangerous, and how any alternative news channel can't be promoted without a mainstream media fact check. 

Not even talking about fact-checks or verification from a political side of the isle point of view (although that clearly does happen), but just that if you want to be an alternative, independent creator or now as the case of Parler on google/app store, even an entrepreneur you've got to get the rubber stamp of approval from the old establishment media and corporate America. 

I'm as free market capitalist as they come, private companies should be able to do what they want and all, but there are a handful of companies/organizations that have clearly gone from no longer being private companies to having way too much monopolistic influence over our lives.  Why would Apple stop at banning your app because it's ~~creating competition for established platforms that benefit Apple more financially being the only game in town~~ ""being used to incite violence"", why not just tell everyone that if they use any aftermarket charger instead of an offical one bought through apple they will brick your phone. What about when a state proposes a new tax or regulation and apple tells people if they don't vote against it they will brick your phone. Visa and Mastercard say you can't use their credit cards to purchase things they politically disagree with, but what happens when they say you lose access to their card network if they find proof you use a competitor such as paypal or some other peer to peer payment processor, ""well terrorists also use those platforms to do bad stuff, so if you want the connivence of a visa card ever again make sure you don't use one of our competitors"".

Parler was created by some wealthy Trump supporter because they believe that conservative voices are not being free to express themselves uncensored on other platforms. There are no subs or groups other then to Follow a person and it is hard to find people to follow really. They list their top people and Sean Hannity it as the top. The Duck dynasty guy is like number 3. The Parler app violates the TOS of both Apple and Google as of now because it is unmoderated hate speech currently. Because of this Parler app has been banned from Googles app store and Apple gave them 24 hours to moderate their users. This platform only exists because they said they would not moderate their users. Now they will need to use whatever the hell other hate groups use but Parlers business model just went poof.

"Even though I don't really care that he got banned, I feel this sets a bad precedence. Twitter basically just made him a martyr when it comes to censorship.

Me personally, between SISEA and this, I feel like it's just going to be an encroachment. I get it, Twitter is a private company... they can do what they want. At least as long as it is towards someone you dislike because people never consider how this would look or how it would be if it happened to someone they sided with. 

Before you say ""In a coffee shop..."" or whatever other places, the difference between a coffee shop and Twitter is that Twitter (like Facebook) have basically ingrained itself into our personal and private lives. Getting banned from Google, Apple, Twitter, or Facebook causes you to lose a lot of potential connections. These are massive, multi-million dollar corporations.... Let's at least not act like it's the same as kicking someone out of a store. 

At a certain point, people have to stop excusing the actions of these websites as ""they're private companies"" and acting they're the same as a Starbucks which exists a dime a dozen not to mention all of the numerous competitors that Starbucks in the form of smaller, locally based coffee shops. Almost no one excuses the shit that Walmart does (mainly underpaying their employees) with ""They're a private company, they can do what they want."" without being called out on how absolutely stupid it is. 

You had many, *many* high profiles or people who are celebs encouraging the BLM riots (notice how I said riots, not protests because they *are* different), and if any of them said ""attack the government"" would they have been treated the same way in this instance? Alternatively, you can question why they were allowed to encourage the destruction of small businesses and black communities (let's be honest, almost no racist was actually impacted by any of it) but god forbid the government feels fear for once in their lives after playing tit for tat with people's lives for the past year? In this instance, it really feels like Twitter cares more about protecting the government and their pr than they do people considering that the encouraged destruction of black communities was allowed but not a near attempt at overthrowing the government.

Let's be honest... with all of the shit that has gone on with his presidency, I find it funny they only banned him once it was ""safe"" to. They don't care about upholding a TOS, they care about taking advantage of a situation to cut loose something they've been wanting to for a while. How much can we really trust multi-million dollar companies that sell data to actually be interested in protecting people? Esp when there are clear double standards for what constitutes a violation of TOS along with the numerous other issues of harassment that come from the website?

Yes, these are private companies but these are not private, small businesses or locally-owned shops and stores. These are websites and corporations that have sunk into the personal and professional lives of many people and they need to actually be treated for what they are rather than just having every action they do brush off as ""private company"".",1610161771.0,1

"The problem in this case is that though Parler has a general slant to it, it is an open platform that operates under the section 230 rules, the same as twitter, Facebook, or any other social media service.   

There are arguments to be made  along the ""It's a private company line"", but consider if Google had banned the Facebook app when it was still trying to promote Google Hangouts.  Even if this is not a clear anti-trust violation, it would certainly be bad precedent to allow something like that without some push back.

It's possible that Google and Apple are doing this not for the stated purpose, but to eliminate a fast growing competitor to a service that they are preparing to release in the future.  Similarly, it may be that large investors in Google, many of which are also investors in Twitter, are also interested in removing a popular competing service.

Look at Parler - Google drop them from Play Store and Apple has basically signalled they’ll be gone from the App Store.

Then there is the pressure from their host AWS.

I support the idea that private companies can do what they like but there are some major concerns with these bans up and down the stack.

That is a shitton of power, Twitter and FB banning Trump effectively means they’re more powerful than the sitting President of the US as they can control his speech. Apple and Google dropping Parler is them effectively silencing an alternative platform.

They seem to actually understand what is going on. These corporations have huge amount of power and can take these actions freely like they have always had the ability to do. Their power is entrenched and protected by government.

The same goes for their (i.e. enter Google and Apple into the posse) sudden policing of Parler. 

These decisions to ban Trump and subsequently police Parler were coordinated. It can only bode for a dismal future because these platforms, especially Facebook, have long been arbiters of free speech and what constitutes its violation.

So, the question is less to obscure or say ""look over here pay no attention to our current discussion!"" but rather ""no, really, why should Apple be treated different from Wal-Mart, when it comes to what services they should be *required* to provide or should not be *allowed* to limit?""

"I totally get where you’re coming from here, but I just don’t see the problem. Per your map example, how are they actively making things unfair — solely from existing? Any other map making product has been made easily available to use on their products (Waze, MapBox, etc.). You cannot complain about a company who prefers to use their own products by default. 

I do agree that it’s a bit annoying that the company actively “steals app ideas” and creates their own version of it. What would you suggest any government do about this? How do you prevent a company from creating specific software? It’s actually very difficult to define when creating these type of laws. 

As long as the competition is not removed in turn of releasing their own version of it, there is no real harm — this is actually healthy competition. A good example of this is when Apple came out with their own version of *Reminders*. Did they in turn remove all other to-do list apps from the store? No, there are a metric shit load of those available. Is it wrong for them to create when there are others that provide their own version of it? I don’t think so.

"While this is fair that's not really how it works. When you take on one giant you take them all on for one thing. If Apple didn't get some attention or treatment of it being a monopoly it would then be the monopoly in that same regard. Not busting them up is how you turn a ""quaint"" business model into a bad one. Plenty of this can be seen in history. A few guys take the hit and then the one that doesn't becomes the bad guy after the fact.

It should be known Apple has also been caught collecting data through Siri without letting it's users know until it was caught. While that might not fair by comparison it means that Apple is not as above breaking the rules if it keeps it relevant. You never want to have one company not realizing it isn't above getting some form of punishment either. I wouldn't want anyone to just own the market or be the only company standing. Not Google or Apple or Amazon etc. Because all of them, regardless business model, care about one thing, money.

Apple also isn't and hasn't been the good guys lately. Partnering with people that have been using child labor and their lobbying against a bill that fights against forced labor. I don't think you can truly trust any of them. Apple wants to make it's devices the singular device. I don't want to imagine a world in which the only thing people use is an iPhone because then Apple doesn't have to change and can still charge an ungodly price. This goes with search engines and cars. I don't want Google to be the only primary search engine but Apple caught wind of the anti-trust suits and are rumored to now be making their own search engine. Which makes sense but why now? Apple made their own login options on sites like Reddit or battlenet so they don't care to make things and deploy them. The timing is what throws me off about Apple. Why haven't they made a search engine anyways to compete with Google? Why wait until Google is feeling the anti trust law suits. Because money. I don't think it's because Apple doesn't care about privacy but it's because Apple sees that they can now be the one search engine to dominate the market if Google's goes away.

This is of course my opinion. But I don't trust Apple either. Apple talks about supporting all of these smaller app developers and businesses but do you think Apple is going to let DuckDuckGo be the search engine if Google falls short?

"The maps argument doesn’t really add up. In order to use Apple Maps you have to have an Apple product. It’s a value add (and you can still install third party apps).

One thing that’s important to bear in mind is that US antitrust laws specifically state that you can’t call a company a monopoly just because they have the best product and mop the floor with the competition. While Apple does clearly advantage its own apps by including them by default, it’s still not clear that this is monopolistic - users expect smartphones to come with basic features like messaging and email.

In the Microsoft antitrust case over Internet Explorer, the final ruling wasn’t that it was illegal to bundle a web browser with an operating system, it was that Microsoft needed to expose its APIs so that other browsers were competing on a level playing field.

"Did you read the article? Does anyone read the article anymore? They go through it in detail. Here, I'll paste the relevant part to save you clicking the link.

&gt;Apple controls about 45 percent of the US smartphone market and 20 percent of the global smartphone market, the committee found, and is projected to sell its 2 billionth iPhone in 2021. It is correct that, in the smartphone handset market, Apple is not a monopoly. Instead, iOS and Android hold an effective duopoly in mobile operating systems.

&gt;However, the report concludes, Apple does have a monopolistic hold over what you can do with an iPhone. You can only put apps on your phone through the Apple App Store, and Apple has total gatekeeper control over that App Store—that's what Epic is suing the company over.

&gt;That monopoly control allows Apple to ""generate supra-normal profits"" from the App Store, the report finds, and those profits have become a dramatically higher percentage of Apple's revenue over time, now generating billions more than the company spends annually to run the App Store.

&gt;Apple also ties its in-app payment system (IAP) to the app store in an anticompetitive way, the committee found. Citing internal Apple communications as well as testimony from the founders of ProtonMail and Hey, among others, the report finds that ""Apple has leveraged its power over the App Store to require developers to implement IAP or risk being thrown out of the App Store.""

&gt;Using IAP raises costs for developers, several testified. For apps that compete directly against Apple's own first-party services, they said, paying Apple for the privilege of making less money doesn't make economic sense—that's the heart of Spotify's complaint against Apple. But developers also say they can't leave iOS, because although iPhone users are a minority of the market, they tend by and large to have more money and be bigger spenders than Android users. (Several of these developers joined together earlier this fall to launch a trade group pushing for Apple to lower its fees and untie the App Store from IAP.)

&gt;The committee found internal documents showing that company leadership, including former CEO Steve Jobs, ""acknowledged that IAP requirement would stifle competition and limit the apps available to Apple's customers."" The report concludes that Apple has also unfairly used its control over APIs, search rankings, and default apps to limit competitors' access to iPhone users.",1610209141.0,1

"&gt;Apple controls about 45 percent of the US smartphone market and 20 percent of the global smartphone market, the committee found, and is projected to sell its 2 billionth iPhone in 2021. It is correct that, in the smartphone handset market, Apple is not a monopoly. Instead, iOS and Android hold an effective duopoly in mobile operating systems.

&gt;However, the report concludes, Apple does have a monopolistic hold over what you can do with an iPhone. You can only put apps on your phone through the Apple App Store, and Apple has total gatekeeper control over that App Store—that's what Epic is suing the company over.

&gt;That monopoly control allows Apple to ""generate supra-normal profits"" from the App Store, the report finds, and those profits have become a dramatically higher percentage of Apple's revenue over time, now generating billions more than the company spends annually to run the App Store.

&gt;Apple also ties its in-app payment system (IAP) to the app store in an anticompetitive way, the committee found. Citing internal Apple communications as well as testimony from the founders of ProtonMail and Hey, among others, the report finds that ""Apple has leveraged its power over the App Store to require developers to implement IAP or risk being thrown out of the App Store.""

&gt;Using IAP raises costs for developers, several testified. For apps that compete directly against Apple's own first-party services, they said, paying Apple for the privilege of making less money doesn't make economic sense—that's the heart of Spotify's complaint against Apple. But developers also say they can't leave iOS, because although iPhone users are a minority of the market, they tend by and large to have more money and be bigger spenders than Android users. (Several of these developers joined together earlier this fall to launch a trade group pushing for Apple to lower its fees and untie the App Store from IAP.)

&gt;The committee found internal documents showing that company leadership, including former CEO Steve Jobs, ""acknowledged that IAP requirement would stifle competition and limit the apps available to Apple's customers."" The report concludes that Apple has also unfairly used its control over APIs, search rankings, and default apps to limit competitors' access to iPhone users.

The reasoning is in the article.

They argue, and Apple admitted, Apple's control of the app store stifles competition and is bad for the consumer.",1610213056.0,-1

they've tried (several times), and it failed, because of the abundance of other options and high degree of control users have over the computer they bought.

"If you think that a company has to get large like Google in order to have a ""disturbing amount of data"" on you then you're sorely mistaken. Any type of app or even decently sized tech company that has access to your GPS has a ton of info on you. If you use this as justification to break up Google, you also need to break up Twitter, and Tinder, and Reddit. Video game companies even. Insurance agencies that have an app. Even pizza places like Dominoes that have installed an app so you can order food delivery has some interesting info on you. 

On the other hand, your other argument that ""voting with your wallet"" becomes extinct is also flawed. Google and Facebook are free. People use them because they are the best, there's actually plenty of competitors, they arent used because they suck lol. On the other hand, Apple has plenty of competitors. Their market share is not nearly as high as Google and Facebook. It doesn't really make sense to split them as a monopoly (yet)

So the one we have left is Amazon, which would be the best option out of 4 bad options listed here. Marketplace has no competitors because of the massive upfront cost of installing thousands of warehouses throughout the country. Even the Chinese knockoff version protected by the CCP is unable to recreate this. 

I dont know if you know enough about Amazon, but their cloud computing services is what makes them the big bucks. In fact, for much of their existence, AWS has kind of been used to subsidize marketplace and Prime. If you wanted to breakup Amazon you would probably just break up Prime, marketplace, and AWS. But then you might find that Prime no longer exists, because the strength of Prime is that it bands together all the Amazon services, although it is the most monopoly-like behavior. And marketplace might not be able to exist, because the operating cost is so high, and without AWS to subsidize it... who knows if it can last. 

I might seem like a corporate shill right now and that might be what you're thinking. But im just trying to point out that its not as easy as you would think.

One day you go to install Steam and play games but Windows only allows you to install programs and games from the Windows store. There is no way around this. But the game you want is not on the Windows store, which takes 30% of their income.

So you can't change OS, you can't change store, you can't manually install. And this purchase was too expensive to switch. Nor can you just not buy it, because it's an essential part to modern living. I'm not sure how hard Apple makes it to switch over to Android either.

"This was my first thought. I am ok with breaking up monopolies IF it is applied equally. 

This is not that. This is old world business exerting influence and money to get lawmakers and politicians to hurt new world businesses. 

ISP's literally took government money in a promise to up their infrastructure and just said nope. AND KEPT THE MONEY. All around the country people only have a single option to choose from. In some cases there are 2, wooooo.

These companies have fought local municipalities creating their own broadband services. They literally fought and made promises to cities who just said screw it we will do it ourselves. Spoilers the cities that have are better for it. 

These companies have spent decades using unfair business tactics to keep their shares of the pie clear of outsiders. And have not been touched for it. 

As far as google, apple, and amazon go. Sure I am not ok with some of googles practices say when it comes to the money spent to keep its browser number one on phones. Or how Amazon treats its employees in some circumstances.

However, that is not where this pressure it coming from. It's coming from the businesses that used to operate that are being hurt. Look at the outrage from the likes of CVS and Walmart when Amazon announced its prescription program. 

I'm sorry but Walmart crying foul about another business coming in and stealing their customers is some giant karmic joke. And I for one think people everywhere being able to get cheaper prescriptions faster, without having to get themselves to a pharmacy is a great thing. Specially with the drug prices in this country.

TLDR: I don't think we can cherry pick companies and ignore others.  And the pressure isn't coming from the treatment or the outcomes of people, but from, business the likes of Walmart who are worried about losing out business they stole from Mom and Pop anyhoo.",1610216143.0,-1
"Well, it *should* be however the consumer wants it, and it would seem that consumers are either happy or indifferent about the current process. The App Store is ideal because at least Apple vets the apps that get published on there to some extent so you can be sure that even if you’re downloading a shit app, it won’t at least brick your device etc, which, given how dumb the average user is, I would argue is necessary. Since the App Store isn’t just acting as a store front either and actually does ensure the apps meet their guidelines/quality/whatever, I don’t see a reason why Apple *shouldn’t* line their pockets.

facebook, apple, google, all are a bit harder to get arround for the services provided that amazon. and at least in my knowledge its those three that abuse things more, with exclusivity deals or, how apple steals apps.  I dont see amazon telling stores that if they sell elsewhere they will be kicked off the platform. (not that it wouldnt be healthier to have more big stores to compete with amazon, I just dont see as much monopoly threat or abuse as the other ones, maybe yall can educate me on stories i missed and no treating their workers like shit doesnt actually count as monopoly abuse, or fighting unions.. this isnt a debate on their evilness, just the monopoly aspect)",1610216302.0,-1

Fact is, *most people* don't ever switch because of these barriers, even if they *seem* small. Fact is the hassle of switching is too much for most people to even consider it. This is why Apple has a monopoly, because their platform is one where users can't easily switch without a high cost.

Amazon: They use their marketshare to bully their way into/out of agreements. They've also taken data from sales of 3rd party store fronts and made their own competitive products. Also acquisitions of competitors(common complaint).

First off, how? Two smaller amazons that sell all the same stuff? Are you restricting one to ONLY selling some types of goods, and the other can ONLY sell other types of goods?

If they sell the same stuff, I'm simply going to latch onto whichever one has slightly lower prices, as will virtually 100-percent of the rest of the market. Whichever of the two has a  larger market share will have lower overheads as a result (mass-shipping and packaging reduces your costs), and the smaller of the two will shrivel up and die, so we're just back to square one.

If they sell separate goods, then they are still monopolies for their individual sectors.

The whole point of Amazon is that it's a single site that I can go to and find everything I need. That is *literally* the appeal/point of the website.

It's the same reason people are starting to go back to pirating movies and TV - Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Apple, etc are all competing, and I don't want to have to pay $20-30/month to 4-6 different companies, so I pirate stuff again.

An example if this in action is say you are a humble little millionaire who wants to start a phone company, you get a buddy to draw up some revolutionary new design and then you go to China to find some place that will make your crap. First problem is right there, any place that can make cell phones cheaply or efficiency is already contracted by apple and of course apple has made it so anyone doing business with them can only do business with them, thats called an exclusivity clause. So you have to either pay more than you can afford to make a profit on or go with sub standard labor.

All the shipping is dominated the same way manufacturing is, so now your asking for 2 miricales just to get you product to market

Now you have your product in America and your competing in the ""free market"" now what?

"&gt;Your argument from my understanding is that windows couldn't have a monopoly in the personal computer space because linux destroyed it in the server space. That doesn't prevent a monopoly in the consumer segment.

I wasn't arguing that Windows couldn't have a monopoly in the personal computer space.

You said 

&gt;There is a difference... Android actually has decent market share

My intention was to point out that Linux's market share was mostly in the server market (or mainframe market, depending on what year it was I guess) and was displacing Unix and competing with Windows NT rather computers running Windows 95 or desktop operating systems oriented more for personal use.  The situation was different because Linux and Microsoft were two competing platforms rather than Internet Explorer and Netscape or whatever the antitrust stuff Microsoft got hit with back then.  Microsoft versus Linux is a very different thing than the Apple store monopoly on software distribution.

Also, I was trying to point out that things were different because Microsoft was actively working to kill Linux.  As far as I know, Apple isn't actively working to keep people from making new app stores to put on iPhones by suing them into oblivion like Microsoft attacked Linux.

"I invite you all to read why breaking up (some) of these companies is not a good idea: https://stratechery.com/2019/where-warrens-wrong/

The crux (from what I understand): Companies should not be punished for providing a better user experience. Google is providing you everything for free, and the fact that everything is tied together makes so many things so much easier. Imagine trying to start a blog or an online business without Facebook or Google (so, so many companies &amp; industries wouldn't exist without these companies). If it wasn't for social media platforms, we wouldn't have heard from the doctors in Wuhan. I could go on and on, and so could you. 
The problem isn't that some of these companies are bad actors, the ""problem"" is that they're too powerful and we don't like it.

That's not to say these companies shouldn't be regulated. These companies all have problems: 
In case of Facebook, it's the acquisitions of Instagram &amp; WhatsApp.
In case of Google, it's the acquisition of DoubleClick (Google's biggest advertising competitor at the time). Both of these have given Facebook &amp; Google a duopoly on advertising. 
In case of Apple, it's the monopoly on App &amp; in-app purchases along with a 30% cut. They genuinely provide a good user experience by standardising the payment and making it more secure. At the same time, they don't allow apps to link to websites where the same digital products can be brought, bypassing their cut. They also don't allow you to price your digital goods differently than other platforms, screwing developers. (Side note: I think shitty practices like these will ultimately cause Apple's downfall)
I don't know enough to say anything concrete about Amazon. Some of their business practices &amp; ethics are incredibly shady tho.

You can't realistically divide any of these companies up. The acquisitions of Facebook &amp; Google were the failure of regulators. You can't simply undo 10 year old acquisitions. Again, that's not to say that there isn't a problem with having so big companies have so much control. But we need to regulate them properly. Breaking them up will be devastating in the short term &amp; more than likely to stave off significant investments into technology in the long run.

My understanding is crude and my explanations are even cruder. You should definitely read the article(s).",1610225831.0,-1

&gt; It's not necessarily a problem of taking profits from the developers, it's more that Apple does it with little to no value added.

By virtue of being on the App Store, your application is certified as safe, and if it turns out to be a bit shit, all regrets can be washed away with an uninstall and a refund, if need be.

I was trying to think about a brick-and-mortar bookstore, where books are sold, but you must pay at the register at the front of the store. I guess this would be like the author or publisher wanting to put a notice on the front of the book that the buyer could instead purchase the book in some other way (thereby denying the bookstore the sale). 

It’s kind of hard for me to think this is a monopoly issue, or in any way inappropriate - a company should have the power to prohibit products (books/apps) from promoting that people purchase the product in some other way (publisher’s website/app developer’s website). 

As far as I know, Apple isn’t prohibiting the developers from selling the app in other ways (as a website subscription, as an Android app, etc.).

"No. I think Amazon hosts around 40% of the traffic on the web, very close to the 50% hard stop on being a monopoly. 

Amazon also will use data from their platform to take out competition in their manufacturing arm. Like they will buy the product from the competitors manufacturer, buyout the whole manufacturer depending and list their product for cheaper and display it first. 

Also I’m not a lawyer and unlike most plebbitors I’ll say I don’t even think it’s specifically because they fit the definition of monopolies they have trust/cartel(?) issues. 

For google and Apple perhaps the issue is they use their market control to impact markets they aren’t in purely for ideological reasons eg you can’t actually have unmoderated free speech platforms. Last I check google+ is dead and Apple never really did social media so why would they be able to arbitrarily throw their weight around? 

The ideological belief of a company or even companies in a particular market shouldn’t be able to destroy competitors in markets they have 0 stake in. 

To put it into extremes, all oil and gas companies can come together and decide they really hate pizza, now suddenly  pizza shops can’t run because no company will provide the gas for the ovens. 

People like referencing the bake the cake bigot shit you may or may not know of. Essentially a Christian baker, who was dead serious about his beliefs didn’t even make halloween cakes, refused to decorate a gay wedding cake. What’s funny is the merits of that case never got debated, it got tossed out due to extreme bias from the human rights commission directed towards the baker. Essentially if they didn’t belittle and mock his faith, and maybe if the gay couple didn’t target this baker just to have a lawsuit, scotus would have to seriously debate whether this mans freedom to choose his customers impacts the ability for a gay couple to have their wedding. It’s always a compromise and it’s not a one and done now we got precedent. Things like, is there another baker available at around the same price. If there is it’s foolish to weigh in their favor, if there isn’t then the court absolutely has to weigh in their favor because the discrimination is leading towards damages. 

Again not a lawyer that’s just what I’ve read and what makes sense to me. My jargon and citation of trust laws is prolly off. Also this has nothing to do with moderation on platforms that’s a different discussion that I would only ask an actual lawyer about. Think whether a business is causing harm is a bit easier for laymen.",1610242135.0,-1
"So the brick and mortar store analogy runs into trouble with these digital products, but there are a couple big differences that the Democrat Report decided to focus on (foreseeing that a judge may also go with the brick and mortar analogy).  

The biggest thing that they try to differentiate in Apple’s case is that in a “supermarket”, the consumer is able to freely leave the store and besides the cost of gas and time, are able to make a choice in where they get their goods. Because of the install price of switching phone hardware, and the inoperability of software which was previously purchased, there is too high a wall for an Apple customer to make a free market decision. 

So to go back to your bookstore analogy. 

Imagine if you had the biggest, best selling bookstore in America, with an install base that had to buy an exorbitantly high membership, and if they bought membership at another store, they would lose access to all the books they have already bought. This is that install size hurdle that is trying to define the App Store market as being just on the iPhone/iPad and doesn’t include other app stores because of the difficulty in switching. 

Now imagine that in this incredibly successful market, you sell your books in the bookstore. It is actually so successful, that if you wanted to make a book and didn’t make it for this store, it’s logistically impossible to be successful. The store charges you 30% off the top of your book to read it, test it, and basically make sure that it’s legible for their customers, in addition to the license you pay just to be able to *make* a book, much less, sell a book. 

This is the App Store part of the story. No one is challenging an issue here, and many people on the committee admitted that a “monopoly isn’t necessarily or inherently bad”. Where antitrust comes in is next. 

You sell a book to your customers and consistently give them new parts of the story. In fact, these customers expect it and probably won’t buy your book in the first place if you don’t. They pay you $1/month to update it, but every time the bookstore takes 30%, even if you’re not using their infrastructure. Your prices rise to cover that cost especially since the store makes you use a different currency that these members use. You try to tell your customers with an insert that you can sell your book elsewhere and they’ll get it for cheaper, $.70, especially since they’re paying in a currency with a better exchange rate and fees (Apple Pay). The bookstore hears about this and removes your books until you stop this. If you don’t, you lose your books, members, paying customers and subscribers. 

TL;DR: Members have to pay a lot to get into the store. So much that they can’t switch. They use their position to bully the books to use their payment system and never mention another under penalty of banishment.",1610242254.0,1

Parler bills itself as a free-speech site, but bans any lefties who try to join it as themselves or parody accounts. But it's also unmoderated in comparison to other sites (which is a big draw for the selective free speech crowd) and then Apple gave them an ultimatum: Fix your moderation in 24 hours or get dropped.

"&gt; I mean free speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of press, two of those three things aren’t on most social media platforms.

There are two issues with that.

One: Free speech does not mean a free platform. Removing Parler from iOS and Android does not prevent people from using it and saying whatever dangerous bullshit they want on the service. It is available on the web.

To put it in olden day terms, you are allowed to stand in the town square and speak but no one is required to publish you in the newspaper if they don't want to.

Two: What about freedom of association? That is also codified in the Constitution. If Apple does not want to associate with Parler, then that is their Constitutional Right.

Parler is toted as a social media platform that does not have this type of moderation.

For example Apple released a statement saying:

“We require your immediate attention regarding serious App Store guideline violations that we have found with your app, Parler,” Apple’s letter says. “We have received numerous complaints regarding objectionable content in your Parler service, accusations that the Parler app was used to plan, coordinate, and facilitate the illegal activities in Washington D.C. on January 6, 2021 that led (among other things) to loss of life, numerous injuries, and the destruction of property.

That's a utility, utilities are different both conceptually and legally.

Your analogy is thus... Much worse, so congrats back?

&gt;Where do you draw the line for ""distasteful"" and ""dangerous""? Is porn distasteful? Are conspiracy theories dangerous? Is wanting to punch nazis distasteful? Is unbreakable encryption dangerous? Is calling for unilateral Catalan independence dangerous?

That's not my line to draw, because I'm not the vendor.

&gt;If you're a libertarian or anarchocapitalist I disagree with you, but fair enough—you believe that private contracts are the ultimate arbiter of legitimacy, I don't. 

I'm not either of those things, though on this particular issue I see no problem with a vendor saying ""no"" just as vendors have said ""no"" all throughout history. They're not saying no for some petty thing like a disability, a religion, or a sexuality, so there's nothing legally to stop them, and I think that's largely fine.

I do think the user should be able to install the app if they can acquire a copy of it though (which is really only a problem in the Apple ecosystem).


&gt;Parler may very well be an illegitimate and dangerous business that should be shut down, but that should be done following a court order following established procedures. 

I really don't think that needs to be a court matter. It might actually be far more dangerous. Courts really shouldn't deal with disputes like this between vendors unless the vendor is being discriminatory.

When courts start dealing with things like this, the government is the one doing the enforcement and that's far more dangerous than an individual publisher/middle man disagreeing with you -- something that's happened throughout history, publishers have never been forced to publish a book.

&gt; Today it is Amazon using their power and privilege against someone you (and I) dislike... and tomorrow?

I mean as someone who worked for a company with a fairly large investment in AWS in the past, getting pulled offline would suck, but if they didn't want to host us, that's ultimately their right.

This isn't even all that strange, it's rather routine for hosts to take down servers that are doing illegal or dangerous things, just like good stores filter out crap products.

The dangerous precedent so many people are going on about is honestly meaninglessly laughable. Parler assuming they didn't tie themselves too much to Amazon specific infrastructure (which is just a bad idea in general) can simply find a new host that is willing to run their web servers or build their own web servers in a data center.

If you really can't find someone to host you in the plethora of available companies you're really doing something wrong. You're the guy who's renting an apartment and making a slip and slide out of the hardwood floors.

The app store problem is a bigger one, and that's where something needs to change if anything. Apple should not be able to determine what you're able to do with a computer. Google already has plans to improve the situation with the next version of Android on their side, but they've always let you install apps from 3rd party sources.

"This was literally division in action, and Redditors celebrated it. Then they complained about how divisive the US was/is over the next 3 years.

The division was caused by the actions that everyone here supported. Redditors celebrated as these companies separated us into our bubble because we didn't like to see people who disagreed with us. And once they were gone, both them and us became more rooted in our beliefs, good and bad. 

Without dissenting opinions, beliefs march towards the extremes, which is almost always a worse place to be. 

Companies talk about ""diversity"" fostering better environments, and that people provide different perspectives on issues and problems. By removing the entire right-wing perspective, news is presented with a complete bias. All news is biased in some way, whether intentionally or unintentionally, having people who inherently want to find a way to disprove the article are helpful for identifying flaws or half-truths in an article and coming closer to reality. Without dissenting opinions, people take news at complete face value, any article, no matter what, if it supports what we support, it must be 100% factually correct. People should know that's bullshit, but they want to believe, so they just do.

I think the actions that tech companies are showing over the past few days will have serious ramifications over the coming weeks, and I expect there to be further purges of right-wing subreddits, /r/conspiracy is number 1 on the chopping block, and perhaps even /r/Conservative. These actions embolden tech companies, which are largely left-wing companies run by left-wing people, to take further action. The internet is almost universally controlled by a small handful of private companies. These companies hold your speech in their hands. If they don't want what you say to exist, they can essentially make it so. If Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, IBM, Twitter, Facebook, and Oracle decide they don't like what you're saying, you've essentially been silenced. It's akin to saying ""Sure, you have free speech, if you're in your own house, by yourself.""

I firmly believe that these companies are the modern day press, and modern day street corner, and that freedom of speech should be required on these websites. It is far too easy for companies to essentially form an equivalent of the Great Firewall for anything they personally don't agree with. And no, I don't think that what Trump is/was saying isn't dangerous. I agreed with the temporary muting of his account, but I'm worried about where this will stop. I don't want to see a future where the internet is only left-wing opinions that are acceptable by whoever works in Silicon Valley. Difference of opinions are what allow people to challenge themselves, come to a combined understanding, and hopefully come away having learned something and possibly changed their mind. If everyone just circlejerks over their shared opinions, we aren't improving or advancing at all.

As a strong supporter of freedom of speech, I am afraid of what the future of the internet and freedom of speech will be. It's unfortunate that freedom of speech advocating platforms are largely right-wing, because much of their content I don't agree with, but I still believe they should be allowed to say it.",1610279785.0,1

"I'm hoping that you're asking in good faith and I can engage in a real discussion. It's very obvious that although preventing violent/illegal content may have been an effect from this, the true goal of this was political in nature. To understand why, it's important to keep the timeline of events in perspective. Parler was, for better or worse, advertised by word of mouth from political pundits as a ""free speech alternative"" platform to Twitter. When Twitter started tagging, labeling, and modifying Trump's tweets, this was suggested loudly by a handful of prominent right-wing talking heads and content creators. 

This next part is a pattern that has been repeated in seemingly three steps for major bans of individuals, but not platforms: Media framing and pressuring platforms to take action, politicians using political speech to admonish and demand direct censorship, and censorship occuring.  As this message caught ground, CNN (and many other minor publications) put out nationally televised video segments and articles likening Parler to a, paraphrasing, ""threat to Democracy."" Then politicians like Senator Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pressured Apple and Google publicly to take Parler off of their app store, then a letter was presented by Amazon employees demanding they not provide web hosting services to the platform. Apple told Parler two days ago that it had 24 hours to come up with a moderation plan that suited Apple's standards or it would be taken off Apple App Store. They did take them off, Google's Play store shortly followed. Then Amazon stripped them of their hosting services. This all happened within 48 hours of each other.

"&gt; At which point does his showboating with national security warrant pulling his account down.

Twitter has been very lenient all this time and they've given him several fair warnings before taking down his account.

"All violent speech isn't okay, both companies Twitter and Parler, should remove it. It's in both of their terms of service as it's not protected speech. Twitter is a multi million dollar company with thousands of employees, do they remove content better, absolutely but they're not perfect either. So to say Parler needs to do it better, how can they as they're such a small company? No company is responsible for what it's users do/say with their products.

For years people have said ""you don't like Amazon or Twitter, go make your own"", some company finally does and it starts to gain traction, Apple and Google remove the apps then Amazon shuts down business with them. What if the credit card companies start shutting down payment processing for services/products they don't agree with? Is that okay? No.

If someone drinks and drives, is the alcohol company or car manufacturer responsible for the car accident? No they're not, same with Twitter/Facebook/Parler/YouTube not being responsible for what users post. People say they're hosting the data, so then they're responsible. I disagree, they are simply the platform. If there's a religious nut job on the street corner screaming about how being gay is sin and the devil is coming, I don't go after the city for hosting him. It's all bananas. 

The real issue with all of this is that it is a very slippery slope. Because whats to stop them from going after anything they disagree with? You can say tinfoil hat conspiracies all you want, but it's a very real concern. What's to stop Google/Apple from monitoring your texts or video calls, they're hosting them, should they be removed? Should Signal loosing it's encryption so big brother can monitor those messages? The answer is no. These companies have a very real monopoly and it's only getting worse. There can never be a better service that comes out, if the competition is nuked because someone used it maliciously.

"Love it when people say “it’s a private company, you can start your own competitor” and then cheer when said competitor gets booted off of every platform so that the competitor has no chance of ever being a viable alternative.

Look at Parler. These people built their own Twitter competitor. And then within 24 hours people were banned from Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Reddit, the Parler app was banned from Apple and Google, creators were stripped of their funding by being banned from PayPal, Patreon, Kickstarter etc., and now Parler itself is being booted off AWS with no chance any other Hoster will pick them up.

People need to start realizing it is not just being kicked off Twitter. These may all be private companies but it’s a concerted effort, every time this happens it hits thousands or hundreds of thousand of accounts on all of these platforms at once. It’s dangerous. There is nowhere to go. They have become the most powerful and meaningful means of communicating and spreading information. Without them, your reach may as well be zero. A billionaire and president like Trump may work around that, but a normal person can’t.

This needs to be addressed. Especially if the reason for such bans is “his speech may have been understood by someone who really wanted to read it that way as a call to violence”. I mean Twitter literally said that “I won’t attend the inauguration” can be understood as “please bomb the inauguration”, and people cheer and think that’s a good thing?!",1610286385.0,1
"Then stop Facebook and Twitter from doing that as well. 

I know my post is long and I won’t fault you for not reading all the way through it, but I do acknowledge that parler specifically has issues that prevent free speech from taking place on their platform, namely direct calls for violence that aren’t moderated even in the slightest. The same is absolutely true on private Facebook groups and on Twitter through dogwhistles. 

I cannot change your mind, violent speech is not free speech. Parler needs to deal with this. Was tik tok particularly violent? What about the phone company huawei? What about 4chan, a website that absolutely hosts violent content and will never be taken down?

If Amazon can decide they don't like the content that your company is providing on their servers, which you are a paying customer for...then I would think that any company that uses their services would have to be concerned over this.  If a private company that uses AWS now has to be concerned that their hosting company is monitoring their content and that there is a potential threat of being shut down in 24 hours.  You would have to rethink your cloud hosting services.  For example, what if a company that provides shareholder data ranking; gives amazon a bad score...but that company uses their hosting services...theoretically, Amazon could ""shut them down"" - it doesn't theoretically ""kill"" the company, but it puts a massive unneeded burden to try and get back online.  It would essentially put them out of business, or at least severely cripple them.  I could see this being used as corporate extortion.  I know that this is a different situation; but the precedent it sets has to strike some fear into every company that uses them.  

I would think that Parler has a law suit that they could put forward.  If you remove the emotion from it all, which I would assume would be done in a court; Their site was at its peak of new growth and the full weight of all major tech providers simultaneously shut them down; the lost revenue and momentum cannot be restored.",1610292594.0,-1

That being said private companies are not the government, and a ban is not an arrest. If you get banned you can go elsewhere, and a competing app, like Parlor, can be created. It is also the right of the publishers/stores, like Google and Apple, to decide not to do business with them. This is capitalism, not a threat on free speech.

Google does not do moderation of user generated content in their Chrome and Gmail apps.  Apple does not do moderation in Safari.

"I don't know if you want or care about a simple explanation but here it goes.

Amazon built a building, filled it with computers and networking equipment, connected it to utilities, and are now renting the computers out through AWS.

Comcast moves data from building to building.  They are renting space on their transmission lines.  Net neutrality means that space on the transmission line cannot get special priority if you pay more.  It is important because the big ISPs have near monopolies over parts of the US.

If Comcast stops your traffic, you are fully off the internet to some users in monopoly markets.  There is no way to get around it.

If AWS stops renting to you, you can rent from someone else.  Apple, Google and Microsoft have competing products.  Smaller companies like Rackspace let you buy your own physical hardware and put it in their buildings.  If none of those options work, you can buy a building, buy some computers, hook up to utilities, and be back online in a few weeks.

"I’m a cloud dev for AWS so let me try and shed some light here. Building an application on top of AWS is MUCH easier than building your own app and underlying infrastructure. And the skill set is almost completely different, so if they wanted to build their own servers too they would need to hire more in demand engineers and keep them in the long term for maintenance/building it out as time goes by. This is very expensive to do considering the salary of software engineers.

This is why huge companies use AWS, GCP, and Azure because the economics of scale simply don’t kick in till you can afford to hire a team of thousands and thousands of engineers to maintain this system. The only people who run their own servers these days are the huge companies like FB, Google, Amazon, MS, Apple etc. Epic Games(Fortnite), Netflix, Airbnb, the US Government, etc all rely  on hosting services of AWS or a similar competitor to operate these things at a viable scale.

So to answer your question, unfortunately gone are the days of everyone hosting something on their own servers in their basement, the economies and scale are too great a factor nowadays.

"Conservatives know it’s legal, and when we talk about “free speech” in this context we’re not talking about the law, but the idea. 

A) Twitter was privately owned and conservatives understood that so they moved to parler, then apple stopped putting it on the App Store, so people started using it on the browser, non of this was against the law however it was an obvious attempt so silence the crowd of people who were using it. Companies promoting this kind of censorship is extremely dangerous to the country and for some reason the expanding far left doesn’t understand this and with companies like this they won’t understand it until to late. People aren’t saying it’s against the law, people are just saying it’s a problem with those companies.

B) Yes there are limitations to free speech, but if you want to only take legal rights into the picture, if a company decides not to moderate a chat on their website they are not legally accountable for what is said or written on their web site:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230",1610309091.0,1

"I think it also begs a lot of questions about how these giant tech companies are regulated. Apple and Amazon in particular, really need to see some anti-trust regulation come their way. Apple can essentially just ban an app from its app store and that makes it impossible to run on their iOS devices. And while there are non-Amazon hosts out there, Amazon encourages its customers to use their proprietary tools to build their infrastructure, tools they can apparently revoke in a matter of hours based on their whims.

I think it's also reasonable to start looking at large communication companies like Facebook and Twitter less as private companies that can arbitrarily set their rules of conduct and more like common carriers who have to carry all communication unless it falls into categories specifically prohibited or regulated by federal law.

Parler has every right to continue hosting it's servers itself and to suggest that Google has an obligation to help or is ""suppressing small businesses"" is ridiculous.

These 2 companies dont prevent the app from being used, they just hurt it.

I also never said I support the bans. I am actually a bit divided. I could go on about the pros and cons of the Epic vs Apple store monopoly stuff, but in this case I would rather briefly focus on the moderation of social media. Currently, we expect these companies to moderate their own platforms, and if they fail to do so, we charge them on multiple counts of child porn, trafficking, etc. They have an enormous incentive to ban hate speech, and illegal activities. Parler does not moderate their platform, which is actually why they are currently in trouble.

Currently, social media apps moderate their own platforms by banning content that they dont feel fits with their brand. This means that some legal content does get silenced on their platforms, and their users fall into a heavily biased hive mind. The algorithms used to moderate, as well as the algorithms used to create your feeds, are poorly made, thrive under division, and are dangerous to our society.

We could, however, classify these platforms like telephone lines. This way, platforms are not held liable for any user posted content on their servers. This would mean people could speak freely, but also means they would leave illegal content visible for all to see. It would be up to the users to remove it, which can be much more difficult, or impossible, to track down.

Additionally, we can set it up so they only remove content upon presentation of a warrant. Which means shifting the responsibility of moderation to the government. Which means slow bureaucracy leaving child porn up for months/years after discovery, and higher taxes to pay for this incredible demand. It also means the government is in control of the censorship, rather than private companies that could fail if they go too far.

None of these options seem great to me, but since I have no idea what I am talking about, I would love to hear your suggestions.",1610314628.0,-1

"This is scary.  The fact that all the comments I see here about it are uniformly cheering it on is even more scary.

First, I'm anti-fascist, anti-Trump, anti-racist, and pro-BLM.  I voted for Obama three times and volunteered for him.

With that out of the way, how can anyone who's anti-fascist and pro-democracy cheer this on?  It's completely insane.

We now have a tiny handful of megacorporations run by megabillionaires who are opaquely deciding what speech we're allowed to consume.  Why are people not only accepting of this but actually cheering for it?

The real problem isn't the idea that a business can choose with whom it does business.  In general, I think that's a fine idea, provided those business aren't discriminating on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.  The real problem here is the fact that we have an oligarchy of megacorporations and megabillionaires.  If we had a truly free marketplace, where there were hundreds of cloud providers, and they didn't act in lockstep with each other, there'd be no problem.  Cloud A would decide they just don't like Parler, don't want to do business with them, and boot them.  They'd just head over to cloud B and everything's fine.  

The problem is that there are **two** companies who, acting together, can prevent you from having a mobile app.  There are **six** companies who, if they act in lockstep, can prevent you from using cloud infrastructure.  There are similarly small numbers of companies who can prevent you from effectively caching content, processing payments, and all of the other stuff necessary to communicate to a non-trivial audience on the Internet.

And, we now clearly see that these companies *do* act in lockstep.  These megabillionaires' interests are aligned, and they are not *our* interests, even if we happen to be on the same page about hating Trump, nazis, and political violence.  Why are you confident they won't use this power to silence speech you do like?  Say, speech about forming workers' unions, or using alternative services to theirs?

That's the problem with free speech: when it's infringed on, it'll *always* be abhorrent speech that infringed on first.  Because 99.9% of people hate nazis, so making nazis STFU is something that's very attractive to almost everyone.  But if you give someone the power to do that, they'll have that same power to make anyone else STFU for any reason they see fit, too.

Here are the arguments I always see about why this OK and why I think they don't work:

1. Free speech is about governments, private companies can do whatever they like.
  * No, the 1st amendment is strictly about governments.  Free speech is a broader concept.  If the government permits any and all speech, but six corporations acting in unison have the power to effectively silence you, and they act in concert to do so in opaque ways, then that's absolutely a free speech issue.  We've lost the ability to communicate freely: it just happens that a corporate oligarchy did it, not the government, but the consequences are the same.
1. Free speech doesn't mean speech without consequences.
  * That's correct, but it's also not the argument.  People on Parler or whatever service should be held accountable for breaking the law there.  Incitement to violence and conspiracy to commit terrorism are already very illegal.  We should **not** expect (or want) the megacorporations to unilaterally and opaquely enforce these laws, we should expect and want or government to enforce them.  This is because when our government enforces them, they have to prove their case in court, and they're accountable to our system of checks and balances; they can't make arbitrary and opaque decisions completely unaccountably like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos can.
1. It's incitement to violence.
  * Incitement to violence is illegal.  It's a job for our legal system, not Mark Zuckerberg.  Also, when you have a platform with user-generated content, in general, we don't consider you legally responsible for what the users write.  You can easily find countless incitements to violence on twitter, facebook, and reddit, from both the left and the right.  Why isn't the reddit app being removed from the App Store?  Why isn't reddit being booted from AWS?  Yes, reddit has moderation policies aimed at preventing this content, but they're clearly ineffective.  Parler also had moderation policies about it (also clearly ineffective).
  * That's how can you make arbitrary enforcement decisions while pretending to be upholding your policies: if you write a policy that's impossible to adhere to, and then selectively enforce it against only those you don't like.  This is what we saw in the Jim Crow south (and continuing to the present day): make a shitload of impossible-to-follow laws, and then only enforce them against black people.  That's **bad**.  Fight against this, even when it starts out being used against people **you** don't like.
1. But Masterpiece bakery (the gay wedding cake case).
  * Did you *like* the outcome of that case?  Did you think it correct and good?  If not, then why do you think it's correct and good here?  That aside, there's not a ton of parallels.  I'm extremely against the idea that *any* business can turn customers away on the basis of their sexual orientation, which was part of the question in that case.  But regardless of that, Masterpiece bakery isn't part of an effectively monopoly, as Amazon, Google, and Apple are.
1. It just means they'll have to communicate another way instead, they're not being prevented from communicating at all.

They literally already have what Apple and Google are asking them to have, but as a small company they don't have the manpower to effectively be proactive to the level trillion dollar corporations want.  Either these trillion dollar companies are not actually reading the rules before they dictate what the rules must have in them or have a more sinister goal in mind.

Personally I have the feeling that it's big-heads basking in the infinite stupidity of the human race and knee-jerking to keep themselves from potential backlash.

"I personally find it absolutely correct that this fascist garbagehole got banned but the fact that corporations can have this much of an impact on public discourse remains and it is super scary and urgent.

With infinite scalability and instant, delocalized information, monopolies form immediately. These tech giants have become infrastructure.

The „private enterprises decide who they give a platform“ works when there’s multiple competing businesses such as different newspapers in even the smallest cities. The fact that Twitter or Apple can just do the same as a global central platform is absolutely not equivalent to that. Most businesses are authoritatively run.

"&gt;able to squash their opponents and get rid of competition 

Which companies here are squashing opponents or competition?

If anything, Trump brought users and business to Twitter and Facebook, so how is removing his accounts squashing a competitor? If anything it strengthened a competitor by prompting users to leave their platforms and go to Parler. 


Amazon doesn't own a social network, so how is denying the use of AWS helping them squash an opponent? Parler was paying AWS so this move results in less revenue for Amazon.

Apple and Google don't compete with Parlor, so how is removing it from their app stores unfair competition?

Your entire premise makes no sense because these companies aren't competing with the people or apps you allege they are using monopoly power to gain unfair market power over. Instead, private companies are simply enforcing their Terms of Service on customers and exercising their right under the free market to deny service to a customer who breaks their TOS.

There are plenty of alternatives for Parler and people banned from Twitter/FB/Youtube. They can purchase their own servers like every company did before AWS. They can distribute their app through 3rd party app stores or make a web-based client. And once Parler does that, people can use it.

&gt;A monopoly on free speech (or a monopoly in general) is not a hallmark of the free market. Free markets are meant to induce competition between firms, Monopolies restrict that from happening.

The only major concern is whether the entire market is actually engaging in anti-competitive behavior by coordinating to deplatform Parler with the *intention of preventing competition*. That doesn't appear to be the case here. Parler is very clearly a loosely moderated platform that violates the terms of service of each of these providers.

These providers aren't getting together thinking to themselves: ""Well, shit. Parler might cut into our market share, we should shut them down."" It's more like: ""Parler is in violation of our terms of service, allowing them on our platform would be bad for business.""

The US Courts have already decided that platforms are not liable if they don't editorialize or approve of posts.  Section 230 allows platforms to restrict the worst posts without being forced to approve all.

"So let me explain net neutrality as it actually is. Net neutrality as proposed, only applied to ISPs. Amazon/google/apple/fb all completely uninhibited. Net neutrality was about marketing analytics. Google apple Microsoft and fb make hundreds of millions (google billions) off of selling ad revenue based on targeted after rising. When you go to google and bing, the second the site is up and run It is monitoring every keystroke and mouse placement in the browser. It knows where you hovered your
Mouse and for how long, what you typed and deleted, it’s all collected under “session activity” and you agreed to it in their ToS. ISPs collect everything you do traffic wise, but they don’t track things you don’t submit, if you type up a diatribe outlining your anger towards a politician, but you don’t hit submit, the ISP doesn’t have that info, FB or other social media does have that info. That helps their advertising for clients. The reason the big tech companies wanted net neutrality wasn’t to help consumers, it was to eliminate literally their only competition for internet marketing revenue. Amazon for instance before net neutrality, through their AWS, gives their clients faster network access to their clients, that means their clients get faster access to data than those that aren’t their clients that is “tolling” the internet that they said net neutrality was meant to stop, except that net neutrality doesn’t stop Amazon from doing that, only ISPs. Internet based corporations have almost no restrictions from net neutrality, only ISPs which creates less competition.  Net neutrality wasn’t a valid answer to the issue.

"Very libertarian view to the freedom of speech.

The freedom of speech ends at the boundary of governance. Beyond that boundary, you may only have rights granted upon you - these are not guaranteed rights. This is what so many don’t understand - especially the alt-right it would seem. This is nothing new, and you’re in the position of these granted rights every day.

Every time you use a device, service, webpage, go to work, visit a business, etc., you are granted new rights respectively. These rights are not always made aware to you, although much of the time they are. Every service, device, job comes with a TOS/TOC that you must agree to before using/purchasing/being employed. Of course most don’t read a single word of these contracts. The thing about contracts is, they’re legally binding. That means if you agree to the terms, read or not, you agree to the rights granted to you along with the rights that are not granted to you. There is no further argument here, and any court will not feel pity for you not having read the contract forgoing your rights. The contact is final, and it is legally binding.

Anyways, to gain access for online data storage and app hosting, there’s also a TOS the developers must agree to. I’d spitball here AWS, Google and Apple have in there they have the right to terminate/remove access and the like for various reasons (inciting violence, and similar). So why are you getting upset here for something that is/has always been their right? Did you not read the fine print? Most likely you didn’t read the TOS like most people.

Another possibility companies are doing this all at once may be they were in it for the money and not enforcing their TOS, and now that Trump is no longer anything important, they’re enforcing their TOS again? The number of things  and number of times Trump tweeted something against Twitters TOS is way too damn high. Any other user would have been perma-banned years ago if they were in his position. I’d understand if you were frustrated about this. I have been. Too many services out there allowed him to run his mouth without punishment like they would normally do to any other user.

"So here's the biggest difference I've seen. Yes, Twitter users might talk shit, but most are people who say it behind their phone screens but won't irl. It's a way of expressing just how passed and fucked the system is. And yes, there was violence in the blm protests earlier this year, but that's a whole can of worms to not open. However, a majority of the protestors started or remain mostly or entirely passive. Again, there are exceptions, but it's important to also recognize the external factors such as them being directly attacked and such that led to those breaking points. But when people tweet about waring the rich or burning a building down, you generally don't see it on the news that they did, and if they did, there's a pretty good chance Twitter would respond at that point instead of just going about business as usual.

Parker, on the other hand, has shown not only the capacity of its user base to be violent and to violently attack the capital building, but to then see that and to actively allow your users to continue to call for and plan for more violence without doing anything to silence those accounts is where the boycott truly comes from. There was never talk about shutting it down when they first started q couple of years ago. Only in response to a planned and intentional attack on the capital building,

One of the rules I try to personally follow is that others have the right to offend. Even if I disagree with their stance fundamentally, they have a right to. However, in this case, it led to premeditated violence and an assault against the capital building because of a lie. Because they stewed in those feelings and that anger together until they got angry enough to attack. Giving them a platform isn't enough to sate their anger. And that's why Apple called for moderation to avoid this kind of action from happening again.",1610348754.0,-1

Apple *refuses* to let these users download Parler's app onto their own phones that they own.  Apple won't host the app, and also won't allow them to download it from somewhere else.

Twitter has been used by many groups and organizations on the left to coordinate and perpetrate violence for the last year and none of those organizations saw widespread bans or suspensions, despite breaking the rule Twitter used to ban Trump and Google/Apple are using to block Parler.

"Haha what? Collecting data on users is not the same as polling the nation. These analytics tools as it turns out, are also not great for predicting opinions, as Cambridge Analytica demonstrated. They were selling a bunk product that didn't work based on masses of private Facebook data.


Furthermore, Amazon isn't a social media platform. If they're doing consumer analysis it's on the buying habits of customers, not their political or philosophical views. The same is largely true of Apple, which makes its money selling hardware and apps.

Your position is that the people have spoken, bit they haven't. Apple and Amazon execs have spoken. And frankly, if they didn't have the ability to almost single handedly crush other businesses, I wouldn't care. I also don't care about whether Parler fails. But I certainly don't buy the idea that the opinions of a few executives is the same as consumers making their own individual choices and I find it concerning that such a small handful of companies has such a stranglehold on communications and technology.",1610352360.0,-1
"Your missing something big in this. Most social media platforms play a roll in amplifying voices. It’s what makes them so profitable in the advertising space, but also what keeps users engaged in the platform. Facebook will show  more people something if similar users view/interact/like. My personal opinion is that this makes the social media platforms semi-implicit in the voices they amplify. Speech isn’t free on social media to begin with, it’s a product. 

I honestly can’t say I have the perfect answer for this because I understand where you’re coming from. I think the strongest argument I can make is that social media companies have a lack of accountability to the content they distribute, and that is what needs to change. If companies want to profit over the censorship/amplification of speech they should be held accountable for it to some degree. I’m not saying that they can vet everything before it makes it onto the site, but they should strong flagging mechanisms that ensure anything controversial that reaches enough of their users  is vetted in a timely manner.

Also to your point about cloud services,they aren’t in the least bit necessary to build applications. They just make it easier and cheaper. Distribution of software gets a lot trickier and seems to be under scrutiny as it is(see the whole epic games/apple lawsuit).",1610353643.0,1
"I agree wholeheartedly it's concerning that so much power resides in the hands of very few executives. Particularly with regard to user data, as you mentioned.

I will still stand by the claim the corporations are incredibly efficient at determining what their customers think. How many times has Apple ""created"" a problem, received backlash, and then customers willingly bought the solution en masse? My position isn't that the people ""have spoken"" - obviously they haven't directly voted. But it's undeniable that corporations are very good at comparing risk and benefit, and those calculations are made, especially in the case of Facebook and Twitter, based on public opinion.

In my opinion, Amazon and Apple's hands were tied, in that they couldn't be the last tech giant providing a service to a platform that helped staged a coup, while the other companies already took action. Public image matters to all corporations, not just social media. How many people canceled their Prime when they learned Amazon warehouses aren't the best place to work?

"I think you're conflating avoiding bad press and a bunch of loud cunts in twitter with actual consumer opinion. Rarely has any hot controversy impacted the bottom line for these companies whether they took the position of critics or ignored them. Businesses routinely capitulate to cry bullies on the internet and new media. Very frequently these cry bullies are loud and have lots of supporters on Twitter, yet represent a very small minority of the population in terms of viewpoint. So I think it's incredibly unwise to assume that a strong business case can be made for every example of capitulation on the part of a big brand or company.

In this case, Apple and Amazon were risking nothing by not removing this company from their platform. No meaningful number of customers was going to abandon their iPhone or ordering shit from Amazon because they didn't cut ties with Parler.",1610354230.0,-1

"Well, I appreciate that you have been able to stay cool headed thus far, I have some thoughts:

&gt;mass banning and dismissing the views of half the nation as Russian propaganda, delusional, etc doesn’t help

No, it doesn’t. That being said EVERYONE - right and left - needs to seriously step up their game when it comes to reading shit online. Just the other day, one of my mom’s conservative friends sent her an article on the election posing as news, it had some URL that ended in .today or something - I ran a whois lookup on it and the URL was registered in North Macedonia. I’m not picking on conservatives here - it is well known that there have been Russian ops to rile up the left side too, posting about fake BLM protests on Facebook events to try and pit people against each other in the streets. Fact is, America has been and is currently the target of propaganda operations to create division amongst the people and so far it is working. People need to be so much more aware that tons of shit being shared online is flat out fabrication and they are unknowingly propagating it. Both sides can point to examples on the other where this is definitely the case. The one thing that does not help is when some of the fabrications are being pushed or even created from the top down - they are treated with greater weight and authority.

I do agree we ended up with Trump because people felt they were being ignored. The critical problem with Trump is that it was the anger out of these people that he captured and it was primarily what he used as political fuel throughout his term. I think anyone can certainly admit that under Trump, American politics are far more adversarial than they have ever been in history (with exception of the Civil War of course). We have crossed a line that has not been crossed and we are in some uncharted territory. Nothing has really been done to tone it down though, not sure if the genie will go back in that bottle either.

I looked into Parler’s jury based moderation system because I was curious what their response was going to be to Apple before they were pulled from the App Store. As I understand it, if something is reported, it is sent to a “jury” of 5 random users for a vote to take it down or not. While this is an interesting experiment in online moderation, it’s doomed to fail and I will tell you why. As you stated yourself, many of the users were either booted from other sites (likely if they were engaging in egregious behavior there) or they only really lean one particular way politically. From the start, this is an echo chamber with only the degree to which a user is extreme varies. Everyone on the site likely mostly agrees with each other already so when something comes up for moderation (if anything is ever reported in the first place), everyone is probably already agreeing with the sentiment even if not the message itself. On top of that, it is continually doomed to remain an echo chamber because why on earth would someone who leans left want to go on a platform where they will certainly be harassed and probably even violently threatened?

Another important misunderstanding that I see many people suffer from currently is that there ARE in fact limits to free speech. There are things you can say that are flat out illegal. We all know “fire in a theater” as the go to example, but [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions) is a good list people need to be more acquainted with: Incitement, False Statements of Fact, Obscenity, Child Pornography, Fighting Words, Threatening the President, Speech Owned by Others, and Commercial Speech. With regards to threats to the president, here’s something very important:
&gt; This also applies to any ""President-elect, Vice President or other officer next in the order of succession to the office of President, or Vice President-elect.""[42] This law is distinct from other forms of true threats because the threatener does not need to have the actual capability to carry out the threat, meaning prisoners can also be charged.

So, there is video floating around that shows some of the insurrectionists chanting about hanging Mike Pence. That speech alone is illegal. Everyone that chanted that committed a crime by doing so REGARDLESS of whether or not they actually have the capacity to carry out that threat. And I think we all know that even worse words can be found online. [Here’s](https://twitter.com/slpng_giants/status/1347190280492089344) just a small sample of things of this nature being said on Parler in the moment as an example.

I think in the case of Parler, timing is also of the essence. Everyone is extremely riled up and that’s a big problem going into the inauguration in less than two weeks. By allowing the flames to be stoked online unchecked, horrible things can be plotted for the inauguration - even if just by a handful of extremists. That’s a pretty scary thing. Deplatforming is pretty much a last ditch effort to mitigate that, and we have yet to see if it will work. I hope for the sake of our country’s sanity that it does.",1610355114.0,-1
"To *you* they are cloud services. It's a matter of perspective.

To Apple, whether they host those services on-premisis on computers they own (""Private Cloud"") is an important distinction from if they run their services on a ""Public Cloud"" like AWS. If you use both (like Apple reportedly does for their services) it's called a ""Hybrid Cloud."" The difference largely comes down to are you paying a third-party to maintain the infrastructure, or are you maintaining the infrastructure yourself.

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-are-private-public-hybrid-clouds/

Just because YOU know and expect that Apple locks down the App Store, doesn't mean that anyone else knows that (or has any reason to know that) before they purchase.  It's not like Apple does ANYTHING to make it obvious that they will censor out apps that publish content they don't like.

"It's not a bad argument. I think the counter arguments would be.

1. If these people aren't radical and aren't ""a nazi making death threats"" there are plenty of already existing platforms for them to be on.

&gt;2. It may further radicalize people (especially the people from point #1) because they feel like they are being unjustly silenced and misrepresented as nazis making death threats that need to be deplatformed.

We would need evidence that the further radicalization of people through Parler's shutdown is more harmful than allowing the already radicalized people organize and recruit.

Ultimately the problem is we don't have evidence. 

But moreover I would also argue that it is not entirely unwarranted. We already know people use these platforms to organize violence. Apple, Google, and Amazon know this and ultimately felt that Parler was not doing enough to prevent it. 

&gt;and it will likely only further divide and anger / segregate discourse by political ideology.

"The problem with that though, is that if you have an iPhone you are agreeing to the TOS that Apple lays out for using their ecosystem. This goes for developers who want to have their app in the App Store. They have to abide by Apple’s terms because it’s their platform or go elsewhere.

If you want to use an app that Apple has removed from their store you need to use an ecosystem that allows it (for example Android users being able to install APKs not found in the Play store). It sucks if you spent a bunch of money on a phone that now doesn’t have all the features you want but you’re not being forced to keep that phone either.

Whether that’s good or bad is certainly debatable, but Apple has the right to choose who they do business with. It’s really the exact same argument as why Amazon can choose to not do business with a company anymore. If you want to be in their house you have to abide by their rules.",1610357866.0,1

 we know that 140 republican members of congress, voted to continue the election rigged russian disinformation campaign after the coup

 we know now, that 140 republicans will repeat russian disinformation even if that disinformation nearly led to the end of Democracy in America

 i mean, maybe some would change their vote now that they know Trump was laughing and calling senators.....i mean maybe they would change their vote now, now that they know you know he was laughing and phoning senators while the rest of the world was scared and/or angry  (or i guess if you're a republican terrorist, which is half of them now, happy)

 that is something this coup led to 

 it also lead to america's enemies, all of them, and their allies, all of them, thinking some things and realizing some things

 i don't know what China really thinks about all this, but i know it's something and it's something they didn't think 5 days ago.....and that's true for every government and probably every citizen around the world, even if they don't know it, something has changed 

 so this coup, it lead to that

 and if there is another attack, it lead to that

 and whatever the results of the election are in 2022, i am sure this coup will have lead to that good or really really bad

 but you might not understand this yet, i guess, obviously not at all, if you are worried about hypothetical stuff or the fact that ""if someone does something totally insane that no one really thought possible or likely, turns out big rich companies can do something about it until congress and the senate decide that they need to make new laws, which they totally can do tomorrow if it turns out they don't like what facebook did and apple did......which really is like not the story right now, at all, really

 

 the story is Donald Trump tried to make himself Putin of America, and about half the republicans in office are okay with that still.....and half the republican voters are okay with that, and ""both sides people"" are really really sad they were really really really really really wrong or in complete denial about what happened or at least how important it is and how it's still unfolding

 because Pelosi doesn't know what is going to happen

 neither does Biden

 neither does Donny

 neither does Zuckerberg

 neither does anyone, including a bunch of people at the pentagon you desperately need to believe do

but you're worried about mark zuckerberg in the future?  you can't even tell what is happening in the present

"It’s just not a viable alternative. Sure you can side load an apk or download an alternative App Store on android but the play store is a de facto monopoly on Android and the agreements google has with OEMs to include play services are anti competitive.

"The reality is it is exactly the same as pornographic material. If you recall the Larry Flynt case, it was the First Amendment that protected him.

I understand your point of view. Why would a private company be allowed to censor someone or a group of individuals exercising their first Amendment rights (as long as they are not breaking the law)? 

The reality is that the Constitution imposes limits on the Government regarding the First Ammendment, but not on private organisations. The government cannot censor an individual or a group of individuals but private organisations are free to do so. This has been tested several times in court, for instance with YouTube where user accounts were cancelled for breaking their terms of service. In all cases, the courts agreed that YouTube is a business and it is not required to provide First Ammendment protection to anyone.

I don't like how YouTube censors and demonetizes certain content that I appreciate, but the only thing I can do about it is to use an ad-blocker to cut into their revenues.

The Internet itself is not being censored by the Government. There is no technical limitation to have a open platform for discussion. The limitation is when you are trying to have a business based on free speech platform that does not moderate illegal content, because you are going to need ad revenue, payment providers, access to app stores,... Because you are going to need other companies to support your business. Nonetheless, pirate websites have existed for decades and despite the efforts of governments and organisations to stop them, they still exist. The difference is that you don't get The Pirate Bay on Apple/Google play store.",1610378826.0,1
"Thank you for your answer, I appreciate it. So is it fair to say that your standpoint is that Google and Apple were completely within their rights to ban Parler, but that they are inconsistent in applying their moderation policies?

I think the distinction here lies in the fact that Twitter, as opposed to Parler, has moderation policies to deal with this kind of posts. It's impossible for them to be 100% consistent in applying those policies because there will always be grey areas and subjective judgments, but as long as they can show they make a good faith effort in applying their moderation policies, they'll remain in good graces. Parler on the other hand refused to come up with moderation policies to deal with the issue of violent rhetoric on their app in a sufficient manner, and that's why they were suspended. I don't think that's unfair?

It should also be noted that Twitter offers explicit leeway to heads of state, like for the tweet you were referring to. A regular user likely would have been suspended for making that post. They did the same thing for Trump. He made probably dozens of posts over the years that would have gotten any regular user banned a long time ago. They didn't take any real action on his account until they felt he was inciting imminent violence. You can disagree with that assessment, but the difference with the anti-Israel tweet is clear: there was no imminent specific threat of violence there and so it did not cross Twitter's red line.",1610379176.0,-1
"I think these centralization of power points are actually much better than the centralization of the internet one. I think you bring up a real issue with the phone market. The fact that there are only a few major competitors definitely makes it an issue when one decides to cut you off. However I’m not here trying to say Apple’s market share is appropriate. People are saying 

A) these companies didn’t arbitrarily decide to cut off Parler. Parler is doing really shitty stuff that is a violation of the boundaries that these companies put in place. People tend to think money is the only thing these companies care about, but trust me it’s not. These companies care a ton about their culture and being held in high regard by their community and employees. Not shutting Parler down could cause a mass exodus of employees and customers who don’t want to support AWS for being ambivalent. Not to mention it’s possible that AWS/Apple could be legally complicit in any crimes that are committed that are organized on their platform. 

B) Owning a profitable business is not a right. And it certainly isn’t a right granted at the expense of other people’s revenue. This kind of rhetoric is super dangerous when people say this about minorities, but that’s a completely different situation. We need some sensible ability to discern between protected classes and malicious hate groups. Normally I would be on your side about consistency of argument, but the reason why protected classes exist is because we as a society said “hey, it’s effed up to treat people different on the basis of x.” We did not say it’s effed up to treat people different for other reasons. Parler is not a protected class and they don’t have a right to Apple’s services, especially if they are going to violate the terms of those services. However if Parler was a community of disabled people, that would be against the law. See the difference? 

When we make a law protecting hate speech as a protected class, then banning Parler as a customer becomes an issue. But right now they’re just a company that’s trying to make money by supporting a hate group.",1610380145.0,1
"&gt; We now have a tiny handful of megacorporations run by &gt;megabillionaires who are opaquely deciding what speech we're allowed to consume. Why are people not only accepting of this but actually cheering for it?  
  
We are cheering it on because Parler is exclusively a social media site controlled by a billionaire who is opaquely deciding what speech those on the site can consume. 
  
However things are not equal.  The degree that Parlor does this is at a level far and beyond any other company with the same size of users. If I had to compare, I'd call it China censorship level while they declare themselves the only spot where free speech can happen.  
  
Parlor actively removes every single idea that is outside their very narrow idea of what a neo-republican viewpoint is.  You post a liberal viewpoint. post removed and you are banned. Post a social democrat viewpoint?  post removed and banned. Except this isn't a 100 person site.  It's a 1 to 10 million daily users site in the position to sweep up the 70+ million republican users into it.  
  
Parlor is designed to actively suck in and keep people in a bubble of Parlor's design, continuously reinforcing that only their viewpoint is the correct one.  There have been sites like this before, but not this scale of number of people joining and using them.  
  
That is why we cheer their action.  
  
So back to your other argument - That there is a cartel of monopolies exercising censorship in unison.  
  
Both Google and Apple are keenly aware they are in monopoly positions. They know they have a very limited scope of actions such as this that they can do before they run a foul of anti-trust laws, and large legal entities such as the ACLU.   
  
I feel strongly that if they did the same thing they are doing to Parlor, but instead of shutting down an app that encouraged a coup against the US, it was shutting down union sites encouraging unionizing, that the ACLU will be on them in seconds. With very strong arguments on why those companies need to be broken up.",1610381441.0,1

I am asking you to think bigger then on this issue. Neo-Nazis are still allowed to protest even though most people don’t agree with them. With the internet being the main way people exchange ideas, I am fearful of that exchange being controlled by companies or tyranny of the majority.

&gt;It's not like Apple does ANYTHING to make it obvious that they will censor out apps that publish content they don't like.

They didn't censor out an app that publishes content they don't like. They refused service to a customer that didn't comply with their TOS. 
Iphones have always been a locked down system. That's fairly common knowledge. Apples rules for accepting apps were very strict from the beginning. Not knowing what your 1000+ dollar device can or can't do is completely on you. 

&gt; if you need to use a corporation's resources to get on the Internet or get an app, what if any 1st Amendment protections should apply to that corporation?

You don't need Apple, Google or Amazons resources to get on the Internet or get an app. I think the CEO of Parler made that clear. 

""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.""

Apple is not the government. They don't make laws. But they do have the right to choose who they conduct business with. I can't find the part that says they can't do that. If you don't agree with it, work to get it changed. But until then the 1st amendment is about government interference. Not the practises of private corporations.

You're going to have trouble finding places friendly to the rhetoric they are currently promoting.  This is nothing like Apple dispersing their data centers.

Go find someone else to belittle. Just because I don't agree with you doesn't mean I'm someone's toy. I have no problem with ""this look"". Playing along while companies participate in destabilizing the country for a few pieces of silver is easily a worse look from my perspective.

The point of free speech is so that the people can govern the country. Because the government does work for the people. And the courts very much do recognize the value of that and the non-value of exhorting people to violence. Parler could keep the political speech up, but instead they consider it important that they also be a forum for discussing how to attack and kill. Companies don't want to be involved in that and I can't blame them. I wish more people felt the same way.

Whether ""anyone can be a censor"" or not, the 1st Amendment protects the people against government censorship, not private companies refusing to print what they don't want to be associated with. Suggesting anyone (company or no) has to be a part of promulgating violence ""isn't a good look"".

Same thing.  If they provided Parler with a way users could load their app without using any Apple resources, I would have no complaint.  I have no complaint about Google's removal because users can sideload apps by downloading the .APK.  I have a small complaint about apkmirror removing it, but they are also a private group who can do what they want.

I agree.  Right now, *legally*, Apple would be completely within their rights to delist every single right wing app there is.  Parler, Fox News, whatever whacked out platform Glenn Beck is ranting on this week, etc.  Dump'em all.  They could say that the App Store and iOS are private curated networks where Apple exercises editorial decision to ensure users do not see content that's illegal or low quality.  Legally, there is nothing stopping them from doing this.  

I am asking a larger, broader question, not about what is right now, but about what should be.  
The Internet is the modern town square and soapbox, and there is a substantial public interest in maintaining free speech online.  But the Internet is largely a bunch of private systems tied together- at a lower level with fiber, at a higher level with apps and services, but all privately owned.  If the owners of those private networks (legally) decide they don't want to carry your content, where does that end?  Can Comcast cut off the Internet service to political candidates they don't like?  That's also a private company who can choose who to do business with or not.  But if Comcast cuts you off, in many places that means you're offline, and have been effectively silenced.",1610387568.0,-1

"&gt; Parler wants to use Apple's platform  ...  Apple doesn't like parler.  ...  It's their choice who to do business with too.

I agree!  Except, Apple makes it impossible to get apps onto users' phones WITHOUT Apple's infrastructure.  

I think it's crappy that Google and apkmirror are delisting them, but I don't have a huge problem with it because Parler can give users the APK directly and users can install it themselves.  That is a perfect free speech / free market compromise- Google wants nothing to do with them and can stay out of it, but users still can engage if they want to.  

If Apple did the same thing- gave users a way to install apps without going through the App Store, I'd have little complaint about them.  Still think it's crappy, but it's their service.  
By making themselves the ONLY source for apps, they are effectively gatekeeping which apps a user is and is not *allowed* to install on their phones.  And THAT is something we should all have a problem with IMHO.",1610388129.0,1

"You are really really funny. Read section A that you just sent one more time, but read it carefully please.

I don't have a huge problem with Google because they can say 'Play Store is a private platform, we choose not to do business with Parler' and user rights are preserved- Parler can distribute the APK themselves, or use a 3rd party app store like Amazon or F-Droid.  

I have a problem with Apple because they explicitly disallow that.  It's not possible to sideload apps on an iPhone.

"&gt; needs to seriously step up their game when it comes to reading shit online

Agreed, I am still learning and have been caught by propaganda a few times. The biggest thing is we need to be more willing to hear eachother out, to use eachother as individuals with different information - when two people with different info come together and work together, they can often find a better way than either one alone

&gt; America has been and is currently the target of propaganda operations to create division amongst the people and so far it is working.

And honestly the way to close the influence is treating eachother as individuals and to recognize that even our own worldview/info may be wrong, no matter how good it feels or how many people around us agree. We need to be OK with being in constant revision, IMO. Thats a big issue in a slot of spheres right now, I think.

&gt; The one thing that does not help is when some of the fabrications are being pushed or even created from the top down

Right, or when other stories simply arent allowed to run. I dunno about you, but I call foul play on the hunter biden story. The media consistently said it was russian propoganda with no evidence... until after the election. Then they started to cover it. About 1/3rd or 17% or something like that (I forget specifically) of biden supporters would have not voted for biden had they known the story.

We live in an informational warfare age. We can either be soldiers and shoot all enemies, or we can try to break out of the game and just be humans. Im trying really hard to be a human and treat others as such

Thats why Im upset here, I feel Ive had the same standard Ive been applying for months, and actually softened up cuz of BLM and talking to people. But seeing everything that was said thrown out the window to attack the entire right based off these insurrectionists really makes me sick. Its some of the most blatant flipping ive seen yet, and I honestly feel like everyone here is gaslighting me 

Am I just crazy?


&gt; The critical problem with Trump is that it was the anger out of these people that he captured and it was primarily what he used as political fuel throughout his term

For some, maybe. Im not an angry person, I am concerned. The democrats platform, as a social progressive who believes in freedom and indivuality and love, really scares me right now. And thats just coming from what theyre saying and doing directly, not even coverage of them. Republicans scare me in a different way, but republicans are also ""do-nothing"" and have no cultural/social backing, wheras the left has EVERY major cultural institution on their side, working with them.

Trump was an avatar of someone who didnt fall to the lefts attacks - he was someone who was still getting stuff done, playing the media against itself, and did not fall. It was the first time we really saw someone stand up to the lefts shit and survive. That was a big thing for a lot of people

His policy proposals and actions were much more in line with how I would live government to work, overall, than bidens or hillarys. Plus both Biden and Hillary seem beholden to the party, where trump seemed a bull in the ivory tower

&gt; As I understand it, if something is reported, it is sent to a “jury” of 5 random users for a vote to take it down or not.

From what I understand, they were playing with it to find a balance - and the jury was for an appeal or something I think. At one point it was 12 people. I have my own issues with the system, but they were experimenting and trying to make their own rules/space. But it didnt follow the rules twitter and facebook have so its gone now

&gt; this is an echo chamber with only the degree to which a user is extreme varies. 

Not quite, I had a lot of moderate creators I follow on bitchute, for example, but the frontpage has a lot more conspiracy. That said, the left has a bubble, the right wanted to make one. The twitter bubble caters to the crazies on the left, the right was making one that was, hopefully, going to shift to be more moderate, but we never got to see.

&gt; it is continually doomed to remain an echo chamber because why on earth would someone who leans left want to go on a platform where they will certainly be harassed and probably even violently threatened?

People were flocking over after twitter banned trump, people have been more and more sick of twitter and facebook and youtube and moves like this push people off onto those other platforms. Every youtube purge, adpocolypse, etc - people move over. 

Eventually, youtube plans to be like a cable network, not a video sharing site. There is more and more reason to explore other options.

I had accounts on these places to follow my personal creators to support the platform and them so they they would be able to make better UI and have more and more moderates come in as there arent other options to the social media ""monopolies""

Now there LITERALLY isnt another choice, cuz if you dont fall in line, you dont have a market.

&gt;  because why on earth would someone who leans left want to go on a platform where they will certainly be harassed and probably even violently threatened?

Why would anyone who leans right go on twitter? They experience all of those things there. We wanted to make our own space, like you guys told us to, and now that space is essentially gone.

&gt; Another important misunderstanding that I see many people suffer from currently is that there ARE in fact limits to free speech.

Yes, but twitter takes it a whole other direction. Parlor was to use constitutional free speech, anything legal is allowed. I like that direction a lot more, personally, though of course it starts off messy.

&gt; So, there is video floating around that shows some of the insurrectionists chanting about hanging Mike Pence. That speech alone is illegal. Everyone that chanted that committed a crime by doing so REGARDLESS of whether or not they actually have the capacity to carry out that threat.

I agree. But Ive also been saying this about rioters in 2020 chanting kill all cops, kill trump, putting a doll of trump into a guillotine, etc. The democrats seems content to let it slide then. 

Im even more pissed about this riot than many in 2020, but I dont see anyone covering for it. Everyone left and right agrees to go after them with the law. 

Im just pissed the left doesnt have the same standard for itself.

There are plenty of tweets still up calling for the death of cops, trump, etc. Twitter isnt being removed from app stores.

&gt; I think in the case of Parler, timing is also of the essence.

Yeah the moments dems have unilateral power there are calls to impeach trump, purge conservatives from social media, and remove conservative platforms entirely. Oh, and now governors are finally stopping the riots in their areas, yay!

"&gt;Just because you don't find Parler as important as Twitter doesn't mean they should be treated differently.

They aren't. Twitter works very hard on state of the art methods of weeding out illegal content in order to be in compliance. Parler doesn't and shows no interest in doing do. Their actions dictate their treatment. 

&gt;If they provided Parler with a way users could load their app without using any Apple resources, I would have no complaint.

So change a core tenet of their business model to satisfy Parler users? It's not the same thing. There's a pretty big difference between removing something because you don't like it and removing it because it doesn't comply with the terms both parties agreed to. 

&gt;Which is it?

Both. No contradiction there. You keep saying ""don't like"". That's where our views on this differ. They should know that Apple will deny resources to apps that are in breach of contract. And they can use a device that allows the app to be installed. 

&gt;Broader question. 

I think access to and use of the Internet should be protected. With each country respectively deciding what content they deem legal to host. Private companies operating on the Internet should, within legal limits, be in full control of how their business operates. 
No one is stopping you from setting up a server and putting anything legal you want on it. The ability to do this should be protected. There are even countries you can get them set up in where the legal part is negotiable. 
Comcast should be able to cut of service to a politician they don't like as long as it doesn't violate the contract they both agreed to. And, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe there are laws in place to prevent this from happening if no other provider is available.",1610393757.0,1

"&gt; Twitter works very hard on state of the art methods of weeding out illegal content in order to be in compliance.  

Twitter moderates their platform to remove material they don't like from being published.  Parler allows users to do their own moderation, determining what kind of content they do and don't want to see, without interference by Parler.  Why is one better than the other?  

&gt; There's a pretty big difference between removing something because you don't like it and removing it because it doesn't comply with the terms both parties agreed to.  

I'd argue that contract was signed, in a sense, under duress.  

Parler *needs* their iOS users to be able to install the app.  They have no huge desire to involve Apple in any of it, but by Apple's own decision, the App Store is the ONLY way to get apps on an iOS device.  Therefore, Parler's only option is to sign that contract.  

Parler did not negotiate any terms with Apple, there was no discussion.  It's a 'take it or leave it, and BTW if you leave it half the worlds smartphones can't use your app at ALL'.  
This isn't the first time this issue has come up- some pornographic apps have had the same problem with Apple's censorship.  

&gt; So change a core tenet of their business model to satisfy Parler users? It's not the same thing.  

So lift restrictions that Apple places on users' personally owned hardware that FORCES Apple to be the ONLY provider of apps.  
To be clear- I'm not saying Apple should host Parler.  I'm saying that Apple should EITHER allow users to sideload apps, OR remain neutral and allow Parler downloads.  
Apple has a right to determine what apps they host downloads of.  Apple does not / *should* not have the right to determine what apps users are *allowed* to install on their own phones.  

&gt; Comcast should be able to cut of service to a politician they don't like as long as it doesn't violate the contract they both agreed to.   

This is a better base of the argument.  If the options are Comcast 100mbit, or DSL 0.5mbit, that's not really an option.  
There are places where private companies serve a public duty.  Telephone and other utilities are among them- Verizon can't kill your phone line because you're campaigning for the candidate they oppose.  Hell, they can't even kill your phone line if you're breaking the law (selling drugs over the phone).  Power company can't cut you off because you advocate for more regulation of the power industry.  Water company can't cut you off because you oppose building a dam.  Gas company can't cut you off because you fight climate change.  These industries are largely private companies, but they are required to serve anyone who hires them, even people they dislike or oppose.  

Apple has, intentionally, set themself up that way by preventing sideloading of apps.  But they shouldn't try to have it both ways.  They should either allow users to install their own apps, or if they are going to be the only source, start acting like a common carrier.  

TO BE CLEAR- I have no problem with Google removing Parler because Android users can sideload apps; Parler can just distribute their APK directly or use a 3rd party app store like Amazon or F-Droid.  My problem with Apple is ONLY because they give themselves ultimate say on what a user *can* install on their own phone.",1610395075.0,1

ISIS didn't have one verified twitter account or official websites, if that's what you're suggesting.

They had many accounts controlled by their members with which they spread their execution videos. Don't you remember? 

They were immediately culled, as they should be.

&gt;What if companies silenced the Black Lives Matter campaign because some protest turned in to riots? 

There are many differences here. First off, BLM was protesting to see an end to police violence against minorities, which is disproportionately high. That is an actual reason. Overthrowing democracy is not a good reason to engage in protest.

Second,  there's no reason to believe that any of the people engaging in arson or looting were ideologically committed to the BLM protests. There is no connection between the goals of BLM and setting a Wendy's on fire. They could very well have been random shit stirrers using the chaos to commit crimes and evidence of such incidents were noted during the protests. 

Third, attacking the capitol building and subverting a free and fair election was the stated goal of the riots in DC. There was no other purpose. There is no charitable light for these insurrectionists to be seen under. BLM has a civilized goal, whether you agree with them or not. The insurrectionists didn't. 

And fourth, I'm ok with BLM accounts and websites being banned if they support violence against civilians or law enforcement. Incitement to violence is not something private companies have to tolerate. The problem is not that all conservatives should be silenced and indeed, many are still allowed their platform. The problem is that conservatives should not be allowed to plot acts of terrorism and in the absence of moderation on that front, such platforms should be denied to them.

It's hard for me to say something is ""removed"" from the internet because I'm technologically literate, I can dig on the internet and navigate to what I want. Even if Google and Apple and whatever remove content it can still be made readily accessible if they (parler in this case) made it accessible, unless isp's choose to remove access but that's a different argument and solved with net neutrality . It's hard to see that being different than let's say Walmart refusing to sell a product. Like yeah I can't buy it at my local Walmart, doesn't mean I can't purchase it. Yeah google/apple don't want to list my website, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. 

Is it big techs people don't understand the internet beyond Google, Facebook, and Amazon? This is the exact reason conservatives oppose government intervention, they don't want the government intervening in the ""free market"".

Everyone recognises the problem in Apples huge market share. App store fees are an example, and they know they had to change so they did. If they knew a court wasn't gonna believe an argument similar to yours, I sure as hell ain't either.

Because one ends in an abundance of illegal content and the other doesn't. What content users want to see doesn't change the legality of that content.

No they don't. They want their iOS users to be able to install the app. If that's what they want, they need to follow the rules for use. 

Apple does not need to negotiate or have a discussion. They don't do that for any other of their customers, so why should they with Parler? They have the right to be fully in control of what the capabilities of their products are and who they want to do business with. If the 13.5 percent of smartphone users in the world that use iPhones don't like that, there are plenty of other options. 

&gt;If the options are Comcast 100mbit, or DSL 0.5mbit, that's not really an option.

Telephone, power and gas are essential utilities. Having a 100mbit Internet connection is not. And besides the drugs, those aren't illegal activities. 

If Apple had a monopoly on the distribution of apps I could maybe agree. But they don't. They have a monopoly on iPhones. If they are to maintain the level of user experience that is the backbone of they business model they need to be in control of what software is run on it.

It has hit recent news that \[trump has been banned from Twitter\]([https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/technology/trump-twitter-ban.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/technology/trump-twitter-ban.html)), and the unmoderated site Parlor that has become a alt-right have was removed from both Google Play, Apple Store, and AWS. This has sparked a lot of online debate about the nature of censorship on the internet, as this is probably the most bold example to date of corporations censoring individuals for the content of their messages.

Censorship in the United States has always been a hot topic, and the subject of a lot of government \[insight\]([https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/encyclopedia/case-all](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/encyclopedia/case-all)) into the first ammendment which very loosely talks about how the government cannot infringe on the peoples freedom of speech, religion, press, assembly, and expression. This has not often been the case thoug, and for as long as the government has had this ammendment, they have tried their hardest to get around it. \[This video\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMB\_I9j5qZQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMB_I9j5qZQ)) does a very good job at explaining the history of censorship in the United States and how it relates to what is happening ""now"" (from December so doesn't talk about recent events).

While many people often get the limitations of freedom of speech \[very wrong\]([https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/free-speech-cliches-media-should-stop-using/596506/](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/free-speech-cliches-media-should-stop-using/596506/)), the actions of those that took place in the recent DC Riots most certainly would not be counted under the guise of freedom of speech, as the planning done was serious conspiracy for imminent lawless action that has a basis. In general, you can plot as much as you want to overthrow the government with your friends and that is protected speech, but the instant you take one serious step to make those visions a reality, it is no longer protected.

However, the legality of censorship and freedom of speech is not what is being discussed right now, rather how that relates to private corporations and their ability to regulate who uses their services.

Conventional wisdom on Reddit is generally that a private entity can fully regulate what is on their platform at their own discretion, as popularly shown in \[this comic\]([https://xkcd.com/1357/](https://xkcd.com/1357/)). This (at least in the US) is not entirely true however. The most striking example of this is the Supreme Court case \[Marsh v. Alabama\]([https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/326us501](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/326us501)) in which a Jehovas witness was arrested for handing out fliers on the private streets of a company owned town. The town argued that since it was a privately owned corporate town, they had control over who/what could be said on thier streets, whereas Marsh argued that their freedom of speech was being violated. In a 5-3 decision the Supreme court sided with \*Marsh\* saying that the company's right to control their own property was superceded by Marsh's right to freedom of speech, as the streets were free to be used by the public. The Court also claimed that in property rights vs constitutional rights disputes, that constitutional rights should be favored.

This may seem to imply that the media companies currently are in the wrong, however other decisions have made this complicated. In \[Lloyd Corp v. Tanner\]([https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/71-492](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/71-492)) the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that a person handing out anti-war leaflets from a mall could be removed, as the mall was not necessary to the protest, and they could have done the same on the sidewalks directly outside the mall. Similarly, in \[Cyber Promotions v. America Online\]([https://www.netlitigation.com/netlitigation/cases/cyberaol.htm](https://www.netlitigation.com/netlitigation/cases/cyberaol.htm)), the Supreme Court ruled that AOL had the right to supress Cyber Promotions freedom of speech to send spam, as even though AOL was open to the public, the ability for a user to recieve emails was neither a municiple power, nor an essential public service.

Finally, and probably the most surprising for me was a 2019 Supreme Court decision \[Manhatten Community Access Corp v. Halleck\]([https://www.oyez.org/cases/2018/17-1702](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2018/17-1702)) in which a privately-owned public access channel was sued on the basis of denying a public forum for freedom of speech. While it has yet to be used, many suspect that this decision will be the basis for future social media suits in which it will be questioned if social media is a public forum that requires fair freedom of expression. In a 5-4 decision by the Republicans along party lines, it was decided that MCAC was \*\*not\*\* a state actor, and thus could regulate what occured on their channel as they saw fit. I found this fairly stunning, as the Democrat justices (including RGB) argued that they (and by extension social media) was a public forum that should be regulated by freedom of speech. Kinda expected the parties to be flipped there.

That's kind of a long winded way of saying that as it currently stands, its kind of unknown the legality of corporate censorship like this. In terms of social media banning users, it appears that the recent MCAC v. Halleck agrees that these services are well within their rights to remove whatever they want. Similarly, you could argue along Lloyd Corp v. Tanner lines that if other platforms exist they could be used.

The grey area of essential public service comes into the decision by Google Play, Apple Store, and AWS to remove the platforms from their services. Since nearly all phones run Android or iOS, do those stores constitute public services? Are they libraries of software that should be forced to contain everything, or are they bookstores that can freely choose via their whim?

Current opinion as it stands right now is Republicans saying that these corporations are infringing on their freedom of speech, and Democrats saying that these platforms are well within their rights to do whatever they see fit. However, censorship on the internet tends to affect all parties involved, and when companies are allowed to reign free we find instances of censorship many Reddit users may disagree with, such as rumors of certain subs being partial to \[censoring anti-chinese government articles\]([https://time.com/5526128/china-reddit-tencent-censorship/](https://time.com/5526128/china-reddit-tencent-censorship/)), or \[Facebook promoting conservative media\]([https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/facebook-twitter-don-t-censor-conservatives-they-hire-promote-them-ncna1245308](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/facebook-twitter-don-t-censor-conservatives-they-hire-promote-them-ncna1245308)) and censoring liberal media.

So the question to be asked is where should the line be drawn on the internet in terms of corporate censorship? Do these corporations being private entities have the end all be all to entirely refuse their service to who they see fit, or have they become all encompassing enough where they are now the equivilent of a town square? Can an ISP scrub and remove information they dislike from packets, or must those be freely handled as the internet should be considered a public utility?",1610421909.0,1

"&gt; What content users want to see doesn't change the legality of that content.  

True.  But the platform's moderation policies necessarily change the content users see- including legal, protected content.  

For example, a meme that shows violence against political opponents is not necessarily illegal- it fails the ['clear and present danger' test](https://mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/898/clear-and-present-danger-test).  Something like 'the only good liberal is a dead liberal' would most likely be considered protected speech.  However a platform like Twitter would remove it almost immediately, because a minimum-wage Twitter moderator isn't a legal scholar.   

&gt; They have the right to be fully in control of what the capabilities of their products are and who they want to do business with.  

I would somewhat agree.  I believe in most cases, a company has the right to decide who they will and will not do business with, and what they will and will not host on their own servers.  And once they sell a product to a user, they no longer have a right to dictate what a user does and does not do with their product, or what software they load on it.  

&gt; If Apple had a monopoly on the distribution of apps I could maybe agree. But they don't. They have a monopoly on iPhones. If they are to maintain the level of user experience that is the backbone of they business model they need to be in control of what software is run on it.   

With respect, this is nonsense.  Allowing Parler or similar objectionable apps does not harm their business model.  Android maintains UX just fine despite allowing sideloaded apps- if you try to sideload an app you get a bunch of warnings and you have to turn off some security stuff to make it load, but then it works.  

&gt; If the 13.5 percent of smartphone users in the world that use iPhones don't like that, there are plenty of other options.  

If the iPhone came with a big sticker on the box that said 'this phone will only run software that contains Apple-approved content', you'd have a point.  But a. the fact that Apple's App Store is the ONLY way to load software on the phone, and b. the fact that Apple can and does remove apps solely because they find the content offensive, is buried in the TOS on page 475 that nobody's going to read in 6-pixel font on a 3"" screen.  

&gt; Personally, I want to decide what I can put on my phone and who gets to repair it, so I use a different company.  
Most people aren't aware of this before they purchase their phone.  Many people buy an iPhone and can't afford to switch, or can't switch because they need Apple-specific services like FaceTime to communicate with their family.

"&gt;Something like 'the only good liberal is a dead liberal' would most likely be considered protected speech. However a platform like Twitter would remove it almost immediately, because a minimum-wage Twitter moderator isn't a legal scholar.

It took me seconds to find examples of that exact message on Twitter. Also someone reporting such a message and being told that it's acceptable. Don't judge them on things they don't actually do. 

&gt;And once they sell a product to a user, they no longer have a right to dictate what a user does and does not do with their product, or what software they load on it.

I half agree. But they do have a right to dictate the capabilities of their products. 

&gt;Allowing Parler or similar objectionable apps does not harm their business model.

Their business model is based on a closed ecosystem where they guarantee apps are compatible with their system and does what the developers claim it does. The ability to sideload apps can, in inexperienced hands, easily end with a bricked phone. 

&gt;If the iPhone came with a big sticker on the box that said 'this phone will only run software that contains Apple-approved content', you'd have a point.

IPhones have always been limited to apps from the app store. There's no reason to expect it to be able to download anything. Not knowing how you're device works is on you, not Apple. 

&gt;buried in the TOS on page 475 that nobody's going to read in 6-pixel font on a 3"" screen.

It's actually one of the first things covered in the TOS. I had no trouble reading it on my phone and peoples unwillingness to read the TOS is not an issue with Apple. 

&gt;Most people aren't aware of this before they purchase their phone. 

Need a source on the most part. I would say most iPhone users know the app store is the only place they can download apps. 

&gt;Many people buy an iPhone and can't afford to switch,

That sucks for sure. Sell it. Buy a cheaper android phone that will do what you want. 

&gt;or can't switch because they need Apple-specific services like FaceTime to communicate with their family.

No one *needs* Apple-specific services to communicate with their family. They may want to, but they don't need to. 

&gt;If you have the right to do a thing, but are deprived the means to do a thing, then you don't actually have that right.

This is just silly. You aren't deprived of anything. What is a connection fast enough to speak online? Do you need a 100 mbit connection? How fast a connection does a tweet require? We used to have 56k modems. Speaking online wasn't an issue unless someone started dialing the phone.",1610430715.0,1

You're confusing sideloading with root.  Root can brick your phone.  A sideloaded app only has access to app APIs, and is kept in the same sandbox as other apps (without the ability to brick the phone).  

&gt; IPhones have always been limited to apps from the app store. There's no reason to expect it to be able to download anything. Not knowing how you're device works is on you, not Apple.  

Many people don't know this.  They also don't expect Apple to remove apps they want to use.  

&gt; peoples unwillingness to read the TOS is not an issue with Apple.  

So when companies do things like put binding arbitration clauses or prohibitions against class-action lawsuits in their TOS, you think that's just fine also?

No one *needs* a phone.  You can use the Internet, or send a letter.  You may want to call someone, but you don't need to.  Except no, we rejected that.  Phone is considered an essential utility.  Internet should be too.

At least the Rupert Murdock's of the world who owned the Western media were somewhat counterbalanced by media in other countries. But now everything is being centralized throughout the internet, and the top 1%ers, who run both the Democrats and the Republicans, have effectively created censorship for the American Neoliberal 1% who is propped up by the puppet Democrats and Republics who only exist to give the illusion of choice and to create infighting among people (e.g. Trump supporters vs Biden supporters) so they can prevent the masses from turning on the 1%.

If any company or individual dares have their own opinion that is not consistent with that of the top 1% or the brainwashed masses (whose thinking is a function of what the top 1% exposes them to), they will be shut down by the top 1% companies who monopolize the flow of information. We are seeing this happen with Parler. Parler only got shut down because right now the top 1% and their puppets in the government, aka the Democrats and the Republicans, have associated Parler with the Trump Capitol riots. Now, I am not sure exactly how guilty Parler is: what their CEO said was that they do work with law enforcement, but that they don't naturally moderate content. I think this is problematic: there should be at least some moderation to remove illegal stuff. But that is not the point, Parler is just an example. We also see Reddit do the same stuff. Reddit is moderated, but whenever someone/some people associated with a certain subreddit do something that reaches the news, and it causes bad publicity, Reddit removes that subreddit. So it is not about Parler's lack of moderation that was the problem here, the problem is that Parler does not meet the subjective standards created by the top 1% companies like Apple and Google, and therefore they were censored/removed. As I said, it is a cycle: Apple and Google themselves have to abide by the monster they created, if THEY don't remove apps like Parler, then public opinion will go against them and they will lose money. So basically, in a capitalist oligarchy owned by the top 1%, a perverse system, a cycle, a loop, has been created, that creates automaticity, and anybody who operates outside this loop is punished, which means everybody (including the lawyers who left Parler) has to think and act according to the same principles (those initially created by the top 1% neoliberal capitalists), which means there is never room for critical thinking. It is just a mindless cycle of actions and thoughts that are good for business. The masses therefore remain ignorant consumers and lack critical thinking. This is exactly what we have seen happen so far.

The masses in Western countries think they have ""free speech"" but this is not true. There is not much difference between countries like the US and authoritarian ones. They both use censorship, but just using different ways. The authoritarian countries use traditional censorship: the state arrests you or uses another way to literally stop you from talking. The Western pseudodemocratic capitalist oligarchy countries who are owned and run by the top 1% do it in a more politically correct/veiled manner which tricks their population into thinking they have free speech: they say you are ""free"" to talk.. BUT.. good luck having a platform... all the platforms are owned by a bunch of billionaires... so you are ""theoretically"" free to talk but you won't have an audience, so in practice, they use their power to censor you if you don't agree with their subjective opinions. They also bombard you with ads and social media from a young age (which also makes it more likely for your parents, your neighbours, your friends, etc... to fall into that loop of mindless social media/consumer mindset which further influences you) to ensure that very few people think outside the box they created in the first place, basically, giving you enough rope to hang yourself. But when shit hits the fan, countries like the US resort to typical authoritarian measures to silence/force people, as we saw with the BLM protests.

To me too.  How is this any different from that?  Removing an app because they dislike the content on the app?  Even if you hate Parler, consider porn- Apple doesn't allow any pornographic apps on the App Store.  There's NO question on the legality of porn.  That is Apple making an editorial decision that they prefer not to have porn on the App Store, therefore users are not allowed to load pornographic apps on their phone.  
How is that NOT acting in bad faith?  

&gt; And I agree that Internet should be the same. The app store or Twitter shouldn't though.  

Twitter is a private community platform.  I think we all need a discussion about the role of private platforms in the Internet age and to what degree their individual rules should be allowed to affect national discourse, but that's a separate issue.  
The App Store WOULD be just like Twitter, except that Apple MADE it essential to load software on the phone.  

- 1st Amendment allows Apple to choose which apps to host or not.  I have no problem here.  
- Users have the right to choose which apps to run on their phone or not.  
- Taking away that user choice- 'we don't like this app so you can't run it even if you want to' is NOT okay.  

You can excuse it with contracts, with the choice to buy another phone, but at the end of the day this is a big company taking away users' freedom to run the app they want to, because that company doesn't like the app.  That's not right.  

&gt; I don't think the 1st amendment covers watching or making YouTube videos. No one is depriving you of rights.

I did read your post and I understand that that's what you believe. However, it is not true. Apple, for example, specifically requested the Parler moderate its content and, if it did, Apple was prepared to leave it on the App Store. Parler refused.

&gt;There should be free speech as long as there are no seriously illegal things, like organizing violent protests, posting credible and meaningful/serious specific threats, or distributing CP, or something along those lines.

Then I fail to see your problem. Sedition is illegal. Parler was hosting sedition publicly refused to remove it.

&gt;But that is not what Reddit/Amazon/Google/Twitter think: they censor (and promote) purely based on what's ""good for business.""

Shrug. If only saying it would make it so. You have a premise but no evidence.

They are not perfect. They are overwhelmed with submissions and often only discover the shit when someone steps in it, but unlike Parler they make a good faith effort. And good for business? Porn would be great for Apple's app store, particularly now when their growth is all coming from services revenue. A boost to their app store income would be great for the shareholders.

So, why isn't there any porn on the app store? They could hide it away behind a X-rated wall easily enough.

Regardless of any of this, if you believe in freedom of speech, then you should also believe in freedom of association, which is a core part of freedom of speech as per the Supreme Court ruling in NAACP v. Alabama, 1958.

These companies are exercising their Constitutional Right to Freedom of Speech to disassociate themselves from Parler. Is that not allowed? If you believe in freedom of speech, then doesn't that also apply to companies?

And if I understand you correctly, you’re suggesting this is more a question of these companies *selectively* choosing to enforce their TOS and you think they could have chosen to keep Parler up without facing legal liability or as much public blowback (or maybe countered the blowback with the honeypot argument). Is that a bit closer? 

If so, fair points all, and my guess is that while you’re absolutely right that companies make all kinds of, shall we say, *morally expedient* decisions all the time and totally do get away with it both legally and in the public eye, the gravity of the current situation is much much greater than some people (especially the execs of Parler) want to admit. Parler played a significant and possibly culpable role in a *historic national catastrophe* that will be remembered as being as significant as 9/11. I would argue that we don’t even yet know just how big this is going to turn out to be, but I’d say that the execs at Apple, Google &amp; Amazon have enough of a sense to know that it’s time to nope out on this one before it gets even worse. And while I’m obviously no legal expert, I’m pretty sure they were staring down the barrel of some major potential legal liabilities which also played into their decisions. 

It’s *possible* Section 230 could have protected them, but they just weren’t ready or willing to die on that hill with Parler and tbh, I don’t blame them. 

There may come a day when some service that’s hosting content for, say, BLM organizers or some future company that’s building a version of Facebook for lefties (“Leftbook” or some shit, who knows?!) and then *they* suddenly get deplatformed for some reason. 

If and when that happens, we will have to debate it or have an honest look now at how to deal with all this and create sound policy &amp; regulations (you know, that shit Republicans hate with such a passion). But for now, I’m not too worried about that “slippery slope” idea because I don’t see it happening in the same way.

Fear not, this will change. This isn't an argument that GoFundMe, Amazon, Google, Apple etc. can't do what they want *right now*, it's that eventually they shouldn't be allowed to, and hopefully won't. Companies are one of the worst entities to hold power at present, to which the level is unprecedented.

"Except you are leaving out some very pertinent facts.

Parler was not moderated. AWS and Google play, and Apple App Store all have TOS, as private companies, they are allowed to do so.

It was violated many times over. This isn’t about free speech. Parler was used to organize and plan an insurrection. 

It was used as a mouth piece for radicalized extremist criminal or terrorist activity.

Parler was warned. Moderate. They did not. Therefore they violate TOS. It’s that simple.

This isn’t about left or right. This isn’t about civil discourse or debating political policy. Parler was used to spread lies about the election, which radicalized many Americans, to the point they were openly calling for public executions and an attack on our government. It want moderated. 

Actions have consequences. 

It’s very alarming to continue to see people put party over the country, our laws, and constitution.

Republicans en masse should be applauding the shut down of Parler. It was a hotbed of naziism, terrorist activity, and the free market sorted itself out. 

AWS, Google, and Apple just like any private business have the right to refuse service to customers. An app that facilitated open seditious, violent activity, spreads disinformation, and breed terrorists, is well within their rights to say, yeah we don’t want this shit on our platforms. 

Republicans really need to stop acting like victims here. They get no sympathy for supporting Parler, or the events of last Wednesday.",1610455388.0,-1

I completely agree and understand the issue of social media and tech companies becoming so big, acting as a town square, and we still have some things to work out.

"&gt; Mega corporations should not be allowed to shut down competition to expand their power by refusing to let smaller competitors access the same advantages they do without checks and balances.

So who is doing this? Care to explain precisely what you mean by this?

&gt; This can be interpreted a power grab by apple, facebook, google and twitter because they can destroy their opponents and absorb their markets.

See, the problem with your 2 interchangeable arguments is that they're mutually exclusive. How could facebook and twitter ""absorb the market of their competitors"" if at the same time ""they're unfairly discriminating and silencing their speech""?

&gt; WHO. TELL ME WHO THEY ARE BANNING. NAME THE ""WHO"" EXACTLY. YOU CANT MAKE AN ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF BANNING ""THEM"" BECAUSE TECH COMPANIES DO NOT PUBLISH OR PUBLICLY STATE WHO THEY ARE BANNING.

Well, apple and google ejected Parler from their platform, and Twitter banned Donald Trump. 

&gt; They could be banning literally anyone without telling you or anyone else. There is zero oversight and zero data driven rational thinking by members of society because NOONE can visibly see, quantify, or measure the actions they take.

So those accounts that got banned, those owners don't have access to the internet? Don't they have blogs, their own websites, a phone? They simply dissapear from the radar, the way the children the Trump administration caged and then didn't keep a record for, preventing them from ever being able to return to their families? I honestly don't see your point. Is your point that twitter et-al should be publishing data about who they're banning from their service? How can you possibly justify that?

&gt; They do not have Courts where deplatformed individuals have an opportunity to plead a case. People deplatformed do not have lawyers who argue their cases, they do not have juries who form verdicts, they do not have judges who give sentences. There is no appeals process to allow cases to be escalated. There is no oversight. 

Lol, that was precisely my point. **YES THEY ABSOFUCKINGLUTELY THEY DO** it's called **the american court system** where they can sue if an **already established constitutional fact** by the SCOTUS that private companies cannot discriminate against people on the basis that I already spoke.

All these poor, voiceless people (OMG they banned their twitters!) cannot contact a lawyer to sue twitter? I don't get your argument. I truly don't. 

I think you're drowning in a glass of water, and I can absolutely see your worry and anger, but the thing you don't understand, is that **you don't understand the thing you're so worried about**. No human rights are being violated. Not even constitutional rights. None of that is happening. The ""corporate wotld"" isn't taking over America (at least not in that sense).

&gt; If you believe that it is right to deplatform certain people then you should be prepared to demand the means necessary to ensure that that power is wielded correctly.

I believe it's right to deplatform accounts that are used to spew hate speech. And sometimes, people individually who, despite numerous warning, have shown that they're not willing to stop spewing hate speech. I don't see the big mystery here, and frankly, not the threat either.

&gt; That's disgusting. Imagine arguing that people don't deserve to have their voices heard because they don't have enough fucking money. Literally disgusting.

That is absolutely not what I said. I said that, if white supremacists were being net contributors to society, then surely one of them would own a tech company that could lend their server farms to Parler. But they're not. So they can't. I don't even believe they have many career-trained classical violinists who could play the world's smallest violin to sing their sorrows. I believe the same thing about jihadi terrorists, fret not. They're an absolute drag for humanity.

They got delisted from major app stores, but mobile sites exist and anyone will be able to use their site again shortly I'm sure.

But that may not really matter here: developers submit mobile apps to Google and Apple for inclusion in their app stores. However, the app it only the channel through which you access the service (Facebook, Twitter, Parler, etc.).

Past the app, there's a big tech ecosystem that make everything work together, which include APIs, third-party vendors (Okta, Twilio, AWS, among others for Parler).

I do not in any way view this particular issue as related to free speech at all, it is about repeatedly failing to take action to self regulate their platform or take action against illegal activity.

If one good thing (Parler getting knocked off the internet) comes out of the iron grip these companies have then I reserve the right to be happy about that one thing while still disliking the practices of these companies in general.

No, it removes the argument that sideloading can brick your phone. It's still a big security risk. How safe their phones are and the guarantee that apps you run on it are verified and secure are a big part of the position they have in the industry. Sideloading will open up major security holes and Apple can no longer make guarantees on the safety of using their product. 

&gt;True, but they do have an obligation to respect users' right to choose what they do with their phone.

They do and you can. They are not obligated to include every feature you want.

Bad faith might be the wrong expression. People aren't really being deceived in either your or my example. 
You can keep reducing Apples decision to them disliking an app, but that's not what happened. They removed an app that repeatedly and without any indication of wanting to change broke their rules. 

If Apple had a monopoly on smartphones I would tend to agree with a lot of what you say. But they don't. They have the right to be in complete control of what product they make. What users want is not equal to a right they have. If that's what you want, buy I product that will do that. There are plenty. 
You have the freedom to go with a different company, not dictate how they run their business. 

&gt;because that company doesn't like the app 

Again, not what's happening. And Apple never gave you the freedom to run any app you want. No freedom is taken away. You are free to buy a product that does what you want. Apple is not obligated to provide you with one. 

&gt;If you have the right to do something, but are disallowed the means to do it, you don't have the right.

your comment proves the point critics of big tech have been making.  a tiny oligopoly of tech companies control access to the internet so that even people who don't want to use them are forced to if they want to communicate with the public, e.g. [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/technology/blocking-the-tech-giants.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/technology/blocking-the-tech-giants.html)

i literally can't buy a phone right now that is ethically made - at some point in the supply chain, somebody will have used unethical labor or environmental practices.

the same response you gave is deployed against those people - labor and environmental activists are therefore hypocrites unless they give up smartphones and computers.   


of course nobody is going to achieve any kind of policy change in 2021 w/o modern technology, so this amounts to saying nobody can agitate for positive change unless they exile themselves from society and become a luddite.

Free speech is free speech. It doesn’t matter whether I want to say, “I love everyone” or “I’m going to kill every person I see from now on”. You should be allowed to say it, obviously acting on it is another story and if anything having people blindly say whatever they want (like coordinating riots/attacks) makes it easier for the FBI and police to track it.

"This is scary. The fact that all the comments I see here about it are uniformly cheering it on is even more scary.

First, I'm anti-fascist, anti-Trump, anti-racist, and pro-BLM. I voted for Obama three times and volunteered for him.

With that out of the way, how can anyone who's anti-fascist and pro-democracy cheer this on? It's completely insane.

We now have a tiny handful of megacorporations run by megabillionaires who are opaquely deciding what speech we're allowed to consume. Why are people not only accepting of this but actually cheering for it?

The real problem isn't the idea that a business can choose with whom it does business. In general, I think that's a fine idea, provided those business aren't discriminating on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. The real problem here is the fact that we have an oligarchy of megacorporations and megabillionaires. If we had a truly free marketplace, where there were hundreds of cloud providers, and they didn't act in lockstep with each other, there'd be no problem. Cloud A would decide they just don't like Parler, don't want to do business with them, and boot them. They'd just head over to cloud B and everything's fine. 

The problem is that there are two companies who, acting together, can prevent you from having a mobile app. There are six companies who, if they act in lockstep, can prevent you from using cloud infrastructure. There are similarly small numbers of companies who can prevent you from effectively caching content, processing payments, and all of the other stuff necessary to communicate to a non-trivial audience on the Internet.

And, we now clearly see that these companies do act in lockstep. These megabillionaires' interests are aligned, and they are not our interests, even if we happen to be on the same page about hating Trump, nazis, and political violence. Why are you confident they won't use this power to silence speech you do like? Say, speech about forming workers' unions, or using alternative services to theirs?

That's the problem with free speech: when it's infringed on, it'll always be abhorrent speech that infringed on first. Because 99.9% of people hate nazis, so making nazis STFU is something that's very attractive to almost everyone. But if you give someone the power to do that, they'll have that same power to make anyone else STFU for any reason they see fit, too.

Here are the arguments I always see about why this OK and why I think they don't work:

 1. Free speech is about governments, private companies can do whatever they like. 

 • No, the 1st amendment is strictly about governments. Free speech is a broader concept. If the government permits any and all speech, but six corporations acting in unison have the power to effectively silence you, and they act in concert to do so in opaque ways, then that's absolutely a free speech issue. We've lost the ability to communicate freely: it just happens that a corporate oligarchy did it, not the government, but the consequences are the same.

 2. Free speech doesn't mean speech without consequences. 

 • That's correct, but it's also not the argument. People on Parler or whatever service should be held accountable for breaking the law there. Incitement to violence and conspiracy to commit terrorism are already very illegal. We should not expect (or want) the megacorporations to unilaterally and opaquely enforce these laws, we should expect and want or government to enforce them. This is because when our government enforces them, they have to prove their case in court, and they're accountable to our system of checks and balances; they can't make arbitrary and opaque decisions completely unaccountably like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos can.

 3. It's incitement to violence. 

 • Incitement to violence is illegal. It's a job for our legal system, not Mark Zuckerberg. Also, when you have a platform with user-generated content, in general, we don't consider you legally responsible for what the users write. You can easily find countless incitements to violence on twitter, facebook, and reddit, from both the left and the right. Why isn't the reddit app being removed from the App Store? Why isn't reddit being booted from AWS? Yes, reddit has moderation policies aimed at preventing this content, but they're clearly ineffective. Parler also had moderation policies about it (also clearly ineffective).

 • That's how can you make arbitrary enforcement decisions while pretending to be upholding your policies: if you write a policy that's impossible to adhere to, and then selectively enforce it against only those you don't like. This is what we saw in the Jim Crow south (and continuing to the present day): make a shitload of impossible-to-follow laws, and then only enforce them against black people. That's bad. Fight against this, even when it starts out being used against people you don't like.

 4. But Masterpiece bakery (the gay wedding cake case). 

 • Did you like the outcome of that case? Did you think it correct and good? If not, then why do you think it's correct and good here? That aside, there's not a ton of parallels. I'm extremely against the idea that any business can turn customers away on the basis of their sexual orientation, which was part of the question in that case. But regardless of that, Masterpiece bakery isn't part of an effectively monopoly, as Amazon, Google, and Apple are.

 5. It just means they'll have to communicate another way instead, they're not being prevented from communicating at all. 

 • The past few days have proven this to be the lie it always clearly was. Twitter bans Trump, and people said, ""well, he can just use Parler if we wants."" Trump says something about using Parler, and then the next day, Parler is completely wiped off the Internet.",1610514385.0,1
"Somebody combed through the social media posts of those arrested for storming the capital. Turns out, none have been found to post on Parlor. They did post to Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

I read somewhere that I can use Signal to replace the default Google Messages app as my default SMS app. I understand this would NOT improve the privacy of my messages if I exchanged messages with someone not also using Signal. But **using Signal for SMS would still work, right -- if I'm sharing messages with users using Apple Messages, Google Messages, whatever**? (In a way, then, Signal in this case would be pretty much like using ProtonMail for correspondence with someone using say Gmail, right?)
3. **Using Signal for SMS, would I still be able to do things like paste pictures into messages?**
4. One of Google Messages's best features is desktop access via the browser app. I hate typing on my phone and nearly always do my messaging on a regular computer. **Could I still use a desktop app with Signal (for ALL my messaging)?**
5. Is there an easy way for me to figure out which of my friends, relatives, clients also use Signal?

Both sides have a habit of treating those who disagree with them as being stupid.  It's common here in the UK too, just look at the debate over Brexit which is chock full of reductionist tribalism.

"&gt; Twitter, Facebook, and reddit have those systems in place and are actively monitoring and removing posts like that.

Parler is a private company and can do what it wants. At least that's what Twitter and FB told conservatives when they were suppressing their posts.

Twitter and FB also hide behind Section 230 saying their not responsible for the content posted by their users. So how is it that 230 protects those companies but not Parler then?

If Twitter and FB have content moderation systems in place, then how did several Democratic politicians get away with inciting and promoting the violence, rioting and looting that took place over 100 days in Portland and Seattle as they lay siege to Federal Government buildings? Including the current VP creating a fund to BAIL OUT PEOPLE WHO WERE ARRESTED?!?!?

What was done to THEIR accounts? Nothing, nada, zip, zilch. 

The FBI concluded the planning took place on FB, Twitter and Reddit. What was the response then for them not stopping this from happening? They are FAR MORE culpable then Parler ever was - yet those platforms were left alone while Parler was targeted and taken down by companies who didn't like what they were doing and shut them down. 

Which should be terrifying to anybody running any sort of app or platform. You are now beholden to the companies who rule over you. The message was clear: ""Step out of line and we'll shut you down. Don't do something we agree with? We'll shut you down. Don't do what we tell you to do? We'll shut you down.""

This is a dangerous precedent. All three platforms have dubious and long histories of refusing to remove offensive content. From the girl who livestreamed her own suicide to the military vet who did the same thing. FB REFUSED to take down either content, weeks and months later. Even after heartfelt plea's from their families Their histories of abusing users rights and private information is well known. For years they allowed Jihadi terrorists to post their executions, hanging and tortures without moderating any of it, allowing terrorists to use their platform as a recruiting tool and to incite violence against the US.

Yet, nothing happened to them, EVER. Oh sure, some lame congressional hearings. Did Apple ever remove FB's app from the app store? Nope. Did they remove Twitter's app from the store for the same thing? Nope. Did Amazon ever threaten to remove their hosting because of what they did? Nope.

"Whilst I do think to an extent its impossible to moderate all content on their platforms, and social media sometimes just serves as a magnifying glass for deeper societal issues, I do have to say Im not a fan of Facebooks model of have your cake and eat it. 

First thing, no way they aren't a publisher. Most people get their news from there. They make editorial decisions. They only people who think Facebook aren't a publisher are their paid lobbyists. 

But anyway, their core model is advertising. To the extent they place pervasive identifiers for you across apps, Web pages and devices, even if you aren't a customer. They also get advertisers who want to work with them to upload all their data with the pixel. This is all to improve their underlying profiles, to then deliver content. Everything is about improving click through. 

So, they operate from a model which at its core, is anti choice and anti transparency. See their recent dispute with Apple actually making this form of tracking an opt in on their devices. Simply put, they would lose too much money to ever reconsider this. 

Then, they have then acquired loads of other services, functions, third parties. Again, to get more data, drive engagement on their platforms etc. All the while advertising their unwavering advertising AI to every modern company out there as being completely infallible. Despite the myriad of bot accounts on the platform etc. 

So for them to suddenly say that they are simply too big to actual moderate their own platform is baloney.  You don't get fat to avoid ever having to diet. They are built a top of a giant data ponzi scheme of automated decisions being made by data gathered from third parties, mixed in with their users and then sold as ad campaigns to those third parties who just provided the data. 

And all these groups, forums, livestreams are just a vessal for them to push products and services which correspond to that specific profile category. You watched this patriots live stream. You went to this location. Well company x wants to sell this to you, patriot. 

They could probably obfuscate that model, at least for certain politically based categories. There are any number of controls you could put in, which in essence would have to deliberately jeopardise that profile. But that would affect revenue. Or they could enforce stricter bans, and permaban people. Again, affects revenue. Or they'd have silo data between their data driven services (oculus, WhatsApp). So there's no intention to do that. 

So instead we have to treat Facebook as some sort of rogue AI, which is fed by more and more data, and is supposedly less and less tamable as a result, like that's some kind of solution. Like if instead of putting concrete on chernobyl, they just kept adding nuclear waste.

The problems with Facebook run deeper than a reddit post can encapsulate, and again they aren't the root cause of all evil.

No, I'm pretty sure I've read the section 230 protections a few times. Apparently you're not familiar with it all, so here's a little refresh for you:

*Section 230 says that ""No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."" This federal law preempts any state laws to the contrary: ""\[n\]o cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any State or local law that is inconsistent with this section."" The courts have repeatedly rejected attempts to limit the reach of Section 230 to ""traditional"" Internet service providers, instead treating many diverse entities as ""interactive computer service providers.""*

As for the rest, I was saying this sub more than the article is hard anti tech, but let’s also talk about that real quick and how modern journalism works. I don’t want to come off as condescending so please don’t take offense, as this was a reality I only learned recently.
Basically, every pro/anti piece of journalism you see is written by either and in house or contracted PR firm. I don’t have a source, aside from having multiple friends in the PR field, and working for companies using PR firms for articles. That small fact opens a window of insight to articles we find on our news feeds. So, every time I see an article on why X company blows, I know someone paid a bunch of money to have someone write this article. Or if we all start hearing about recipes using Water chestnuts because they are a super food, it’s because Water Chestnut Farmers Worldwide paid a bunch of money to get a series of positive articles written for them. Ok, whatever.

Fuck loads of Anti FB articles. Fuckloads of anti google articles for a while, then stopped for some reason. Though nothing as changed.
Apple has been blowin our nips off with all the great articles recently. Neato. They are still killing kids in China to make their shit.

I remember the stuff about Apple being largely responsible for the agreement and Jobs calling some other CEO (maybe Brin) to chew him out about recruiting their employees.

" Hello, just here looking for some advice and some insight into the apple MacBook air. I have always had Windows laptops, and I am now getting sick of the windows terrible build quality as a whole, and the slow downs they experience after a year and a half to two years.

For context: I have just graduated university and now working, so I will be saving up for a bit before I make a purchase (also I am from Canada), but my current laptop has almost bit the dust. I am looking at the new M1 MacBook Airs and am curious at what / how big the differences are between the 7 and 8 core GPU models. Ideally I would love to save money as I am NOT a gamer and not doing anything crazy in terms of graphics / editing. Eventually would like to get into music recording but that is up in the air right now. Would the base level - 7 core GPU with 8 GBs of Unified memory be sufficient for everyday usage for the next 4+ years?

Any advice is welcome, and thank you in advance!",1610713906.0,1

"&gt; Isn't cancel culture just another way of describing the free market? People are allowed to boycott what ever and whoever they want. If a person or company does something I don't like I don't support them any more. What's the issue? Isn't that free speech? Am I missing something? 

yea, you are missing a lot.  With free speech comes the inherent risks of violence, and offense.  You will most definitely be met with thoughts you do not like.  You don't have to partake in those thoughts, you can ignore them.  But you do not have the right to end those thoughts.  Being liberal means that you support the rights of others to have views opposing your own.  Everyone supports people who have similar ideas.  So when a leftist says ""I support BLM"", its like yea sure, of course you do, and you'll support every other left leaning group and idea, that's not ""liberal"", that's just agreeing with things you already like.  Liberal would be agreeing with the ability of others to speak their minds, particularly those who you disagree with.

&amp;#x200B;

So why do we have free speech, I mean it can offend people, it can lead to terrible ideas, it can lead to violence, what could possibly be the upside to free speech, that is so great that it out weighs all of the negatives?  Well, for starters no 1 is omniscient.  The way that you are able to perceive reality, is through limited senses &amp; cognitive ability.  For instance, you can't look behind you and in front of you, you can only focus on 1 thing at a time.  [Human perception looks like this](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gifer.com%2FTGgc.gif&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fgifer.com%2Fen%2FTGgc&amp;tbnid=k2mV2rzRlpEt8M&amp;vet=12ahUKEwjU2oHNop7uAhVGHVkKHVzVBu8QMygBegUIARCEAg..i&amp;docid=81xMwoa8R35_XM&amp;w=320&amp;h=240&amp;q=spot%20lights%20gif&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjU2oHNop7uAhVGHVkKHVzVBu8QMygBegUIARCEAg), the spotlight is 1 person looking around in the darkness.  Well the question is, what is the most important thing to pay attention too?  Well everyone of course will be able to positively say, what they are looking at is the most important thing \[that is why they are looking at it\].  You need opposing views to enable people to compare and contrast their views to help find the best way through the darkness \[unknown\].  The cost is that some views will be wrong and die out, but its only the view that dies, and not the human.  When you remove peoples ability to communicate to 1 another their different views, you remove the ability to find the best way forward, or most important thing to look at.  So when unify all views to be exactly the same, eliminating those you disagree with, you then lose the ability for the idea to die, and replace it with the ability for the human to die.    

&amp;#x200B;

So what's the big deal with big tech?  who cares, they are a business, not a government, their servers they can do what they want right?  That's just capitalism at work right?  No, not really.  First of all, all businesses in the USA are held accountable for their actions.  You have OSHA, EPA, FDA, etc. then you also have legal repercussions \[ie if the news runs a hit piece on you, you can sue them for damages\].  Big tech does not have any of these regulations, they are 100% above any and all laws thanks to section 230, which enables them to operate more like a place of public domain, IE a public square, rather then a place of business or technically rather then a publisher \[like any news source is considered a publisher\].  Except in addition to being above the law, they have all the powers of a publisher, meaning they can decide what is and is not on their website.  This gives them all the power in the information age.  They get to change what people look at, they get to decide where all the spot lights are going, 1 small group of unelected people, operating on what they think is best, good intentions mostly.

&amp;#x200B;

You might say, well people can build their own platform, and the answer is a resounding no, they can't, anyone who does will simply be labeled a terrorist, thus unfit, and all big tech will follow suit, IE Parlor.    You might say that its no big deal, you can say what you want in public, or in private, and the answer there is a resounding no.  First of all, you don't know if you'll be doxed online, lose your job and such, so better stay quiet.  Secondly, lets say you have 100 friends on Facebook, and those 100 friends have 100 friends each, when you post something, you affect 100 different people in some form or another \[that's just how society works, I am having an affect on you, just as you are having an affect on me, and everyone in this forum is affecting one another\].  That means you are only 2 people away from affecting 100 million people.    That's the power of social media at the moment, stripping all that power into the hands of the few is going to yield catastrophic results, as it completely undermines the whole point of free speech, in the name of the dangers of free speech, using the worst aspect of humanity, which I would say is the ability to demonize our human enemies, thus providing the self-justification of any action against them.

&amp;#x200B;

One needs to realize that society itself is indeed tyrannical in nature.  We constantly give each other signals, whether it be verbal or just through body language, what sort of behavior we like, and dislike.  This is how formation of governments have come to be, you have a society that operates on a set of beliefs, that society then puts those beliefs to paper, then the government sets the rules, and enforces those beliefs.  So when the west was rising, and the whole enlightenment was happening, the birth of ""liberal"" views \[and I mean in a western sense, not an American sense, which means conservatives in America are considered liberal as well\]. The concept was to stop any entity from being so tyrannical that it could completely prevent any competing views.  It was a self realization of ideology essentially, and a vow against being blinded by it.  Now we just have businesses capable of being bigger then society itself.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do we do about it?  Not only does big tech control algorithms of what you see, giving birth to hedonistic echo chambers, which is a big problem, as noted by the left leaning documentary recently posted on Netflix \[although they only critique the conservatives, while ignoring their own potential failures\].  But who should police the public squares, should it be big tech?  It is their servers after all.  I think not, I think they should only profit from ad revenue, and perhaps a sub fee if really need be.  We as humans came up with this idea of a state monopoly on violence, AKA the police which means the police protect the law and order, and then judges get to judge whether a law was broken, and that's the system we should follow for online as well.  Perhaps it will need tweaking, after all the chances we get such an important matter done right on the first try is infinitesimally low, and it is essentially a global service so we have major hurdles to come up with.  But ultimately, big tech companies like Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple, should decide whether they want to be a publisher or a public forum.  If they decide to be a publisher they should be responsible for everything on their servers, meaning if a pedophile puts up child porn they would be legally responsible as well as the pedophile, with the liability and accountability, they would then have the power to censor what ever speech they wanted on their platform, as they are the ones who would be held accountable for it.  Alternatively, they can decide to be a public forum, this means they abdicate all liability and accountability for what is on their servers.  The liability becomes that of those who post, but this also means that they cannot moderate the public forum.

In 2013 Amazon was part of the DOJ anti-trust suit against the Big 5 publishers. It was proven that the Big 5 publishers, along with Apple, formed a cartel to force a certain pricing model and raises prices.

Amazon did not want the Agency model, publishers responded by pulling their books from Amazon.

It is simply undeniable that Parler had way more of those people than most if not almost any platform. That is a connection.

3. Parler simply refused to do something against hate speech and violent retoric on their platform which is the main reason why it was dropped by Apple, Google or WWS and why it was significantly worse than almost sny other site.

"I don't think your first point is valid.  Its a common point I hear being made here, but it obviously fails to capture the true nuance of whats going on right now with big-tech censorship.  

for instance, In the past if Walmart didn't want me to spout my ideas in their store, then I would have to take my language to the street, or to the bar, and say it there.  That was their right, if they want to exercise it on their land.  But now a-days, it would be as if Walmart owned every piece of land all the way to the arctic circle.  And they said ""sure! Have your ideas, but you cant say them on our land!  Im afraid you'll have to leave"" and as a result I'm out there alone on the north pole speaking to nobody.  

When free speech laws were designed we never foresaw companies having *this much* of a monopoly on the dissemination of information, we thought only government could hold that much power, and we really need to revisit these laws in order to protect one of our best methods of finding truth.

Don't think the antarctica analogy is accurate? Look what happened to Parler.  We all said, ""sure if theres a market for a more free speech oriented internet forum then one will emerge."" And one did! and it was successful until Google took it off the play store, apple took it off the app store, and amazon refused to provide server space.  Even if Parler were to find a way to exist Google could hide it from search results with ease, they control virtually all internet traffic. Thats monopolistic and dangerous and both liberals and conservatives alike should be concerned with it!

With regards to the Galileo example, and Epstein example, they were merely used to convey the idea that the mainstream narrative can be wrong at times, and that the free dissemination of information can open us up to new truths.  If need be one can come up with a million other examples given that those two weren't satisfactory.  

My final point is that we've now exchanged different ideas about free speech, and I know that through writing this reply I've gotten a better handle on what my own ideas are and what a counter idea might look like, and thats awesome! That helps us refine our worldview.  But Reddit could easily ban one of us, and if Google and Facebook followed suit we would go the rest of our lives without ever having heard anyone make a counter argument, and thats the fucking problem I'm worried about.",1610782964.0,1

"“yet no one on the right has ever thought to create a social network to compete with the current big players.”

Kind of seems ironic to say that when the subject at hand was an attempt at that. 

“the internet isn't controlled by the Left. Nothing stops someone from making a new, actually free platform.”

While I will agree that the left doesn’t “control” the internet, there are certainly heavy hitters that lean socially left. The thing that stopped them from creating a new free platform was Apple and Google removing Parler from their app stores. Not to mention, Amazon pulled access to their servers when Parler didn’t change their ToS to Amazon’s liking. 

There’s a big misconception that Parler was refusing to take down posts instigating violently storming the capitol. The reality is, Parler’s moderation team was made up primarily of human staff and didn’t remove posts through the use of algorithms. Which, I feel that if someone is trying to make a platform that sticks to free speech principles, algorithmically removing content fails to judge the nuance and context of a post. As I understand it, Parler was removing violent posts, as instigating violence is not protected by free speech. However without automatically removing posts they didn’t have the manpower to keep up with what was happening.

I think it’s wrong that Apple and Google removed Parler from their app stores as punishment for “causing” the storming of the capitol. If this standard were applied evenly, Facebook would be removed (which I would also disagree with) for being used to plan the violent protests of this summer. I feel that if Parler sticks to its principles, it’s closer to a true platform than most other options available.

“the left somehow ends up getting de-platformed from it.”

I haven’t heard cases of the left being de-platformed, but I guess I wouldn’t be surprised as many people today treat their political “opponents” as lesser than their own group. A lot of the societal and other social problems that have arisen recently are a result of this behavior. 

For example the “would you punch a (insert evil group from history)” scenario, but then claiming your political “opponent” is that evil group to justify violence against them.

Despite having said all of this, I think the creation of more and more social media networks is more likely to cause division than unification. One of the problems is that people will often flock to others that share their ideas, thus creating echo chambers for themselves. That’s how you end up with so many people that were once moderate hating the other side. That’s why so many people aren’t willing to compromise to solve anything. Everyone now believes that their solution is infallible and that anyone who disagrees is an idiot. I feel that the more social media platforms there are, the easier it is for people to isolate themselves from anyone different than them.

While I understand that a blocking feature is needed for the cases of harassment and other abuse, it’s often misused to block anything you don’t like. I was on twitter recently, and saw that they added a feature that allowed for the blocking of specific words and phrases. In some situations it could be positive, but I have a feeling it will generally be used by people to block words and ideas that differ from their own.

Between the problems I’ve listed above and the general willingness of people to be more rude online than in person, there are a lot of flaws in social media as it stands. I think that instead of feeling the need to make a new platform for everyone to agree on, there should be some changes to allow for more discussion, disagreement, and other sharing of ideas.",1610831628.0,-1

&gt;The campaign should be focussed on this then, not indiscriminate censorship of a platform. Do you not realise the dangers of that? Political power is cyclical....

&gt;do you want those people feeling outraged because the ""political elite"" and ""social justice warriors"" are trying to silence them? 

That covers 2, 3 and 4.  Sorry for the poor editing btw.

&gt;I believe that the law should be enforced and anyone breaking the law....

Covers 1 and 5.

Calling for people to commit violence is perfectly legal.  In order to get legally punished for it you have to do some very specific things that give demagogues a LOT of wiggle room.  

Look at how Bill Oreilly kept calling Doctor Tiller ""a baby killer"" and how ""good people have to do something about him"" until Dr Tiller was murdered.  He and his hate station were never punished for what in a sane society would be a call for terrorism.

According to our laws Parler didn't commit any crimes so hitting them in the wallet is the only way to pay them back.  You're pretty consistent in your stance against apple and the rest cutting ties with Parler so they would suffer no repercussions for their actions.


&gt;Do you believe that is insufficient

Yes, wholly insufficient.

Like I said there are quirks in american law that would protect people who posts calls for violence but aren't the ones who take direct action.

Our laws are very friendly to stochastic terrorists.

We have one anti abortion group called Operation Rescue which specializes in demonizing abortion doctors, finding members who are likely to be pushed over the edge into committing murder, radicalizing them by taking them to people who murder abortion doctors who give them encouragement and then they pretend to be shocked when that member murders a doctor.

They operate entirely within the law even though I don't see the difference between them and the people who radicalize suicide bombers....aside from their complexion.

Fox regularly eggs its viewers to commit acts of violence until someone gets killed or there's a terrorist attack then they play dumb.

To sum it up, your method would lead to only the participants in attacks getting punished not the organizations that push for the attacks or give a microphone to the people who want others to do violence on their behalf.

We wouldn't even be able to boycott businesses that support right wing stochastic terrorism which means they will never suffer any consequence for the violence they cause.



So I'll ask you, what would you want done about organizations that operate wholly within americas bizarre laws but encourage stochastic terrorism?  I gave a full answer to your questions, I'd love to see your response to this one!

Actually, “they usually don’t implement that”? iOS has an extraordinary rich backup and restore function and has had it for years and has only improved... iOS has the capability to export local backups of the entire device in various ways with extra layers of strong encryption. Moreover, when hooking up the iPhone to Windows or Mac (wired (or wireless if you authorise the device)): apps can establish a local encrypted communication channel to exchange data... So iOS really is absolutely not the problem here for a change; it has plenty of options to safely harbour stuff like this and tons of other apps do offer it securely. I can understand Signal not wanting users to back it up to iCloud perhaps, although it should be their choice, but nothing should be stopping them from allowing local exports.

Last but not least, even if all of the above would somehow be a problem or not available; nothing would stop Signal from generating an encrypted file in-app and then allow to share this to local storage, cloud storage of choice, email it, AirDrop or whatever they want...

Besides, why are we even arguing about it? The Signal devs themselves have said as much that it’s on them. :X 

I’ve already explained to you that when connecting the device to a PC or Mac you can establish a secure channel in which apps can directly exchange files with your PC/Mac, the app can automatically enable this on connection or do it on demand and their “filesystem” is sandboxed from the other apps that might do the same. You can even get third-party tools like iMazing to manage this as well with far more capabilities (it may be closed source, but the API is very extensive!), but that’s just a bonus.

(Local filesystem, export to local app, cloud services, your local NAS, AirDrop, you name it: all possible out of the box.)

So no, this is not an Apple issue at all, it is 100% a Signal issue. Apple actually offers more options than Android in this regard, out-of-the box anyway. It looks like you dislike Apple.

"This is a false dichotomy. Platforms are an inherent part of the freedom of speech. There's a reason that the first amendment contains the freedoms of speech, assembly, and the press in a single package. It's because they are inexorably linked to the basic post-enlightenment philosophy of freedom of expression. 

The question isn't whether or not the right to a platform is part of the freedom of speech. It is. The question is one for corporations and government regulators and the voting public as to how much protection needs to be extended into privately-owned means of expression. 

Take California, for example. We have a Constitutionally-guaranteed right to freedom of speech. The courts have ruled that this extends into private businesses that serve as *de facto* town squares, such as shopping centers and malls. You have a Constitutional  right to use those private businesses as a platform for speech and expression and assembly. Now, so far, the Supreme Court hasn't extended that Constitutional right to a platform into the online equivalent, places like Twitter and Facebook, et cetera. Will they? I don't know. 

But what I do know is that we regulate businesses for the public good. The phone company is, for instance, a common carrier. They generally can't de-platform you because they don't like the content of your speech. There's been more push to regulate the internet this way, with net neutrality. And I think it's time to start considering extending it to internet businesses that serve as important backbones of communication, whether it's carrying IP traffic or serving as a public forum. I think people have recently started to wake up to the power over communications that a handful of companies have, and how regulations currently allow them to execute it at their whim, rather than according to the public good. 

The deplatforming of Conservatives might actually be the best thing that happened to freedom of expression online, because a lot more of them are likely to be joining civil libertarians in calls for increasing net neutrality and regulation of essential services and forums on the internet to be more in the interest of the public good than the parochial interests of these companies, some of whom (like Apple) seem to be engaging in anti-trust practices.",1610992434.0,1

The guy they voted for is standing directly in front of them, and pleading for them to overturn the fair election he just lost - by any means necessary. His supporters are free to disagree with Biden, they are free to commiserate, they are free to discuss productive, non-violent means of fixing the nation. what they aren't being allowed to do, is to get together on the internet and plan a violent coup, or terrorist attacks. the bottom line is that we share a nation with a handful of dumb folks who worship Trump/guns, and who are prone to violence.. the best thing we can try to do in the short term (while trying to fix our broken education system long-term) is to make sure they can't easily plot to assassinate Nancy Pelosi, Mike Pence, or AOC because the guy they voted for is a sore loser with a big mouth and no moral compass.. 

all of a sudden the free market that MAGA loves so much is cancelling them for their seditious actions and calls for violence, and the snowflakes act like their rights are being trampled because they can't use their favorite social media platform to form a right-wing militia anymore. free speech is important, but we have to use our brains and draw a line between ""free speech"" and ""stupid BS lies and fearmongering that are going to get people killed"".

"Reminds me of this story from Vanity Fair back in 2014 about Samsung colluding with cell providers to commit price fixing. Blocking investigators from entry, hiding evidence, destroying evidence, and even literally eating evidence.   
  
https://www.vanityfair.com/news/business/2014/06/apple-samsung-smartphone-patent-war  

&gt;	One day in March 2011, cars carrying investigators from Korea’s anti-trust regulator pulled up outside a Samsung facility in Suwon, about 25 miles south of Seoul. They were there ready to raid the building, looking for evidence of possible collusion between the company and wireless operators to fix the prices of mobile phones.  

&gt;	Before the investigators could get inside, security guards approached and refused to let them through the door. A standoff ensued, and the investigators called the police, who finally got them inside after a 30-minute delay. Curious about what had been happening in the plant as they cooled their heels outside, the officials seized video from internal security cameras. What they saw was almost beyond belief.  
  
&gt;	Upon getting word that investigators were outside, employees at the plant began destroying documents and switching computers, replacing the ones that were being used — and might have damaging material on them — with others.  
  
&gt;	A year later, Korean newspapers reported that the government had fined Samsung for obstructing the investigation at the facility. At the time, a legal team representing Apple was in Seoul to take depositions in the Samsung case, and they read about the standoff. From what they heard, one of the Samsung employees there had even swallowed documents before the investigators were allowed in. That certainly didn’t bode well for Apple’s case; how, the Apple lawyers said half-jokingly among themselves, could they possibly compete in a legal forum with employees who were so loyal to the company that they were willing to eat incriminating evidence?",1611021294.0,-1

So we do that by driving them off simple, easy-to-access, open social media networks, and into underground heavily-encrypted darknets that can't be monitored?  How does that help anybody?  

&gt; we have to use our brains and draw a line between ""free speech"" and ""stupid BS lies and fearmongering that are going to get people killed"".  

It's not our line to draw.  In the history of public speech, EVERY time an idea has been deemed 'too dangerous to allow' that has been the start of tyranny.  Every time.  Or, point to sometime when suppressing an idea or set of ideas by prohibiting its discussion has has a positive effect?

"Well said and more nuanced than most.  Have an upvote.  

&gt; Just because a crime involves speaking doesn't mean it's inherently legal due to the freedom of speech.  

In general, I'd agree with that.  For example, if I get 4 guys together and I instruct them how they are going to rob a bank' that's illegal even if I never touch the stolen money or participate in the robbery (I'm guilty of conspiracy, and there is no questioning that).  
Same thing with false advertising- if I say my donuts are sugar free, and they're not, I've misrepresented the product and my speech is not protected.  

But the juicy one- I'm not allowed to incite violence.  If I am addressing a crowd and I said 'everyone go kill a police officer!' there I am absolutely inciting violence and I am guilty whether someone attacks a cop or not.  
But there is a huge gray area there.  If I address a crowd and I say 'we need to take back our city!', I could be saying people should join neighborhood watch and report illegal activity, or I could be saying we should form citizen patrols to keep drug dealers out, or I could be saying we should take up arms and overthrow the government.  Which is it?  

I believe if there's ANY question, one MUST err on the side of free speech.  And even that is a slippery slope to avoid if possible.  

-----

&gt; Have you ever considered that the people who rattle off a list of constitutional rights and say ""the constitution"" a lot don't actually seem very fond of constitutional rights? For example, you seem to think people should be required to grant a platform--not very keen on their freedom of speech, huh?  

I very much consider this.  Apple and Google have a right to speak just as much as Trump or Parler.  And that speech can include NOT repeating the words (or computer code) of others.  But that decision not to speak MUST NOT stop or prevent the speech of others.  

Specifics- Amazon and Google both terminated Parler's accounts.  I think that's kinda crappy, but it is their right to do so, if Google doesn't want to host Parler's app then that is their right.  I believe Google should not be *forced* to expend resources hosting content they want not to.  Users can sideload Parler's app or Parler can post it to F-Droid or another alternative app store.  

Apple is a different story.  Apple, by design, builds iPhones to refuse to run programs that don't come from their App Store.  And that is a conundrum- I believe Apple has the right to choose not to host the app, but I DON'T believe Apple does or should have the right to tell users they aren't *allowed* to download the app on phones they own.  So Apple is trying to have their cake and eat it too- on one hand they want a monopoly on iOS app distribution, on the other hand they are not willing to act as a 'common carrier', so they are dictating to people what apps they are allowed to run on their phone.  THAT is not okay.  

More broadly, there's a question we all should ask- if the public square is privately owned, how should 1st Amendment protections apply?  
I don't have the answer there, but I do think that when the public square is privately owned, the private owner does have at least some responsibility to uphold the Constitution.  
How to implement/enforce that without creating a much bigger problem, I don't know.  Always open for ideas :)",1611041717.0,-1
"&gt; No, I’m saying if they’re going to pull a “breach of terms” as the reason to terminate their contract, any other companies that breach the same terms also be terminated, but they aren’t, they’re allowed to stay.

The difference is that Parler refused to even attempt to moderate the illegal content. Apple publicly stated they could stay on the app store if they did. At that point, the choice - and the consequences - became Parler's.

&gt;This is important when it comes to business because a flexing of power can be seen as breaking antitrust laws if applied unevenly and unfairly, as in the case with AWS and Parler.

"&gt; There's been countless articles written about how Facebook was the primary planning tool, not Facebook.

I've googled it earlier, and honestly the opinion seems very split. I don't think you can say anything definitely on that matter, unless you cherry-pick your sources.

Besides, that's not my argument... I said that **BOTH** platforms were used for malicious activity, but Parlor is *designed* for malicious activity.

&gt;  these companies Google/Apple/Amazon, are selectively applying their rules

I agree. But I think the argument is being bent too much into a ""left-wing vs right-wing"" argument by the (right-wing) US media, with US-centric worldview, into a political debacle.

The platforms are only doing the *bare minimum* that they can get away with, when it comes to specific *forms* of activity - such as racism or violence. They've failed for years to prevent a spread of general misinformation, or sufficiently crack down on fake accounts manipulating their algorithms.

&gt; These 3 companies have too much power over the internet and they're acting too much like publishers filtering content and services.

I'd at least add facebook and twitter to that list.

I think there needs to be a more formal, legal set of requirements for what *should* be filtered, but at the same time I think private platforms have every right to filter *anything else* that they feel like. It's your choice to use their platform, under their terms of service, so if you think they're over-filtering then you can go elsewhere.

And ironically, I'd say that much of the right-wing US media outlefts (e.g. Fox News), who have for years been a laughing stock of the world for fake news and misinformation, are equally guilty of failing to censor dangerously inaccurate claims from being published.",1611058953.0,-1

Apple and Google can turn down whatever apps they want, they're a private company, the scary thing in my opinion is Amazon AWS turning off their hosting. 

This kind of sets a precedence that these new start ups have to do business the way Amazon tells them, as they host most of the internet. So how's a small startup supposed to build a huge server farm?

Parlers rules ""followed"" the law, meaning illegal content was supposed to be moderated, so incitement of violence ect. However, they weren't doing it enough, but I'm partial to the idea that it's just a matter of scale. They're a startup, how can they moderate that many users so fast? 24 hours notice isn't a lot of time to get their shit together.

"Excerpts from the article:-

""Brave, which currently boasts 24 million monthly active users, has been an early supporter of IPFS, working on the standard since 2018. But with version 1.19 of the Brave browser releasing today, Brave users will be able to access IPFS content directly by resolving URIs that start with ipfs://. They can also opt to install a “full IPFS node in one click,” making their browser a node in the peer-to-peer network. 

“IPFS gives users a solution to the problem of centralized servers creating a central point of failure for content access,” Brave’s CTO Brian Bondy said in a statement, adding that this gives Brave users “the power to seamlessly serve content to millions of new users across the globe via a new and secure protocol.”

IPFS project lead Molly Mackinlay adds that IPFS’ enablement of the decentralized web can overcome “systemic data censorship” from governments and Big Tech. “Today, Web users across the world are unable to access restricted content, including, for example, parts of Wikipedia in Thailand, over 100,000 blocked websites in Turkey, and critical access to COVID-19 information in China,” says Mackinlay, “Now anyone with an internet connection can access this critical information through IPFS on the Brave browser.”

This effort to make web content more resilient and unconstrained comes at a time when service and platform owners are facing tough choices about what content should remain online. Following the Capitol riots, President Trump was silenced on both Facebook and Twitter, followed by the Parler app being pulled from both the Google and Apple app stores, and Amazon withdrawing its centralized web services. A decentralized web enabled, in part, by IPFS would make that kind of control more difficult in the future. """,1611077096.0,1

"&gt; Asking you to leave my house doesn't violate your constitutional rights.   

Correct.  It's my property, you are a guest, and I can order you off my land at any time.  
The same principle DOES apply to a hosting company.  If I'm a hosting company, what I put on my server (and what I refuse to put on my server) is both my choice as a business and also to some degree a form of speech.  If I don't want to host Parler, I should not be *legally required* to do so.  

That doesn't make it right or good for me to kick off things I don't like.  I believe if I'm a hosting company, I *should* not be editorializing with which customers I serve.  But what is good/right/moral and what is legally required are rarely the same thing.  

With that all in mind- I think what Google and Amazon did is crappy, but it's only Apple I have a problem with.  Apple intentionally designs its phones so they refuse to run software that doesn't come from the App Store.  So Apple's decision to not publish the app isn't just affecting Apple's servers, *it's telling millions of conservative iPhone users that they are **not allowed to install an app that they want on their own phones***.  And THAT we should all have a problem with.  

On an Android phone, you can download an app as a .APK file and install it yourself.  That way if I want an app Google wants nothing to do with, I can do it myself.  iPhone has no such capability.

"Oh I heard that.  But understanding is a three-edged sword- one side, the other side, and somewhere in the middle lies the truth.  

Apple/Google/etc's position is that Parler was removed for not removing objectionable content (as defined by their respective AUPs).  Apple especially was quite specific on that, and made it clear that if Parler started any sort of effective moderation / removal of App Store prohibited content, their app would be restored quickly.  

Now, a quick question- did you bother asking what Parler's position is?  I did.  Their position, essentially, was their app empowered users to be their own moderators, and thus any central moderation was antithetical to their core tenets.  As far as I could tell, Parler (the company) took no position on the DC riots or discussions of them.  
A lot of right-wingnuts used Parler, but that's because it was one of the only remaining platforms that didn't impose top-down moderation, NOT because they supported the riots.  

That to me is the key- this dispute isn't about riots, it's a fundamental disagreement about how online communities should be ran.  Apple/Google/etc believe in centralized content controls, Parler believed in decentralized user-side filters.  

Now a small disclaimer- I was never on Parler, so I can't comment on what exactly was discussed on the site.  But as a Liberal/Libertarian, I believe that a site like Parler *should be ALLOWED to exist,* even if it quickly turns into a cesspool.",1611125820.0,-1

"My amount of knowledge currently / ATM is limited but I still want to claim BS on your claims that it's about optimization (though of course to some degree it can be) as your knowledge is likely lower and you just make those statements anyway. Though I'm fully aware others know more about this and may be able to contribute further:  
This is the part I have an issue with:

&gt;It's the same reason that an Android phone can have 12GB of RAM and a  4000mAh battery where an iPhone has 4GB of RAM and a 2500mAh and the  iPhone is arguably faster and with the same battery life. 

Let's begin with Android phones vs Apple phones:  
As for RAM Android phone software typically is written in Java running on a Java virtual machine with automatic memory garbage collection. Android may also keep more things running in the background (you didn't used to be able to use two programs simultaneously on the iPhone?), I don't know if the wider hardware support may increase RAM need further still beyond the virtual machine.  
As for speed and battery it's my impression Apple at-least just recently had the widest/most beefy cores as in large cores capable of doing more things per clock resulting in higher single core performance but also used fewer cores. It's not uncommon that how fast you can run one thread affect how fast/interactive/snappy something feels. It's easy to run many things on one (fast) core but it's often harder possibly impossible to split up on task into many pieces to run over multiple cores. Also they may be ahead in the queue to get access to a new manufacturing process, like this last time with 5 nm where the 5 nm processing node likely offer more performance per watt. Using less RAM I guess also result in using less power and Apple iPhones at-least before typically used smaller screens with lower resolution both of which result in lower power consumption once again (running something at 30 fps on a 720 vs a 1080p display for instance require less pixels to be drawn requiring less work.) I actually would assume the display difference explains quite a large share of the power demand and battery size difference and the use of JAVA and possibly multitasking the memory difference.

But as for the M1 that's relevant for the laptops and desktops and there the typically Apple program unlikely was running in a Java VM in the first place. If anything running x86 code on the ARM processor could had introduce additional overload, not saying it do as Apple are doing it. However I will be saying that typically RISC code use more RAM than CISC code as CISC designs have more instructions doing more complex things whereas RISC code have fewer more simple instructions which mean that you may have to utilize multiple instructions to get one thing done which on CISC would just require one instruction. And as the program in that case will be made up of more instructions more RAM will be needed to hold those instructions.

So just because an iPhone use less RAM (because Android use JAVA) doesn't mean an M1 computer will (possibly the opposite as the CPU design may use fewer less complex instructions.)

As the RISC design may not have instructions resulting in as complex behavior the it could be made more simply and smaller on the other hand it may have to be feed more instructions putting demand on the memory solution instead. It's my impression the Apple ARM cores have been very large and likely wide though. I don't know if they are ""more RISC"" than the Intel cores. But simpler instructions = more instructions = more RAM.",1611128701.0,1

"Except the purpose of apple isn't to make life better for society, it's to make money. The purpose of the government is to benefit society. And, proportionally, for what you might spend at apple, you get better and more useful products as time goes on. For what you pay to the government, do you get nearly the same return?

And most of Amazon's money literally goes back into Amazon in order to make it better. 

&gt;What I DO see is a lot of government jobs available with decent pay and benefits for those who are qualified

How easy is it to get a government job when you're unqualified, and have cushy benefits, and keep it a long time, compared to a private sector job though?

&gt;roads that run from my house to anyone else's house in the entire country, a cheap, easy postal service that delivers to anyone in the US, safety in buying groceries, generally safe tap water, regulated automobiles that I know will have a basic level of safety and are regularly tested, a guaranteed financial payout based on my years of working experience and compensation, and a whole host of other services that work just fine.

And I see roads in disrepair for years, cheap and efficient postal alternatives, overly strict or incompetent classifications, a government-led water crisis, vehicle recalls and private innovation driving safety features, a slush fund for governmental expenditures, and plenty of other services that are either passable or beyond useless.

&gt;I'm not saying that every government-run service is amazing, I'm saying that the government doesn't have the motive of earning a profit for shareholders at the expense of the consumers or the country in general, and for services that should be available to everyone and have a ridiculously high barrier to entry in the competitive market, getting rid of that profit motivation for the group providing that service can be really, really good for consumers. 

But it should have a motive of benefiting society, and it often doesn't do that. Even when it tries, it's often inefficient and wasteful. And sometimes that profit motivation can also be really, really good for consumers. Thanks to Amazon (who also sometimes does their own shipping), the USPS and other delivery companies have expanded their Sunday deliveries. 

&gt;Everyone knows that they're not technically a monopoly, but they engage in monopolistic business practices and have enough market share at this point that they know that customers will continue spending money on Amazon goods/services to make up for a few returns here and there, and at the end of the day they earn a massive profit.

How can a company that isn't a monopoly engage in monopolistic business practices with any effectiveness? There are plenty of alternatives to Amazon in a wide variety of categories. You could buy/sell at Walmart, host on Azure, use a different digital assistant, buy other tablets/streaming devices, use other streaming services, deliver with UPS, etc. There are numerous alternatives. Amazon is big, and makes a lot of money, but it is not close to being a monopoly, nor does it engage in monopolistic practices.

&gt;Sure, because 25 years ago the DMV was a slow piece of garbage because it wasn't funded well enough to run smoothly, and making fun of government inefficiency has been a pastime for a lot of Americans for years and years because of confirmation bias where people notice the things that confirm their bias and tend to ignore the things that don't confirm their bias.

Like noticing the existence of roads but ignoring the potholes and cracks? Or remembering your quick trip to the DMV and ignoring the slow, long lines of others?

&gt;But there's a reason that the government runs certain services, and that's because it makes more sense to have the government run a service when it costs absurd amounts of money to compete in a space, there's little or no competition, the service is a necessity for the vast majority of people, and building out enough infrastructure would allow for unlimited use without adding real cost.

But there is competition in the ISP space, although that's hampered by regional monopolies that exist because of the government. The internet isn't a necessity, but it is widely available these days.",1611178928.0,1

Apple knows that, ultimately, this is probably not an issue that most of their consumer base cares too deeply about, definitely not enough to shadow the reasons they would buy their products in the first place. Apple has *always* had control of their products in its DNA. Their biggest tagline in history “it just works” is *dependent* on it. If users think they should be able to use the products they acquired for one platform on another platform they can get one that offers that, or change platforms. Isn’t that how markets work?

"&gt;Except the purpose of apple isn't to make life better for society, it's to make money

Right, to make money for the owners, regardless of how it affects everyone else in the US. If you want everyone in the US to have faster internet speeds, you either privatize it and let the price increase due to high barriers to entry, or you make it a public service funded by taxpayers so the majority of the money doesn't go into the pockets of the stockholders.

&gt; For what you pay to the government, do you get nearly the same return? 

As time has gone on, we've gotten significantly better service at the DMV, so there's one quick example where you get better products over time. Do you get the technological advancements? Who knows. Probably not, but I'd rather have high speed, cheap internet for everyone in the US starting now, than keep everyone paying an arm and a leg for internet now and getting faster speeds in 10 years that keep increasing in price.

It's not that I don't want faster internet, it's that internet service is still extremely useful even at basic broadband speeds, and providing that to everyone is something that I think is really important. It makes applying for jobs much easier (as in, you don't have to go to a library if you don't own a car or have mobility issues), it makes it possible to get telemedicine, book appointments for all kinds of services, update legal documents, and all sorts of other stuff that you can only do online at this point. 

&gt; How easy is it to get a government job when you're unqualified, and have cushy benefits, and keep it a long time, compared to a private sector job though? 

About the same. The government has just as much incentive as private companies to try to hire only qualified people, and just as much incentive to fire those that break the rules. In both cases, big corporations don't find it worth the legal risk to fire employees that are just slow or bad at their jobs, so you'll always find plenty of people that aren't great at their jobs just coasting along until retirement. I've seen it in every company I've worked for.

&gt; How can a company that isn't a monopoly engage in monopolistic business practices with any effectiveness? 

Because they have the money and the market share to set prices to whatever they want. Monopolistic business practices don't require an actual monopoly, they just require that the company is willing to take a temporary financial hit in order to discourage competition. Or they can price fix with a few other big companies (which they're currently under investigation for).

&gt; Like noticing the existence of roads but ignoring the potholes and cracks? Or remembering your quick trip to the DMV and ignoring the slow, long lines of others? 

Exactly. I know that my most recent experience at a single DMV doesn't mean they're all great now. I also know that my last 5 experiences at 3 different DMVs in 2 different states doesn't mean they're all great. But I do know that at least some of them are pretty good, so clearly it's not just an 'all government-run things completely suck' situation.

&gt; But there is competition in the ISP space, although that's hampered by regional monopolies that exist because of the government. The internet isn't a necessity, but it is widely available these days. 

Sure, it's not a necessity in that you don't need it to survive for a month if you already have food, water, and shelter. But it's absolutely a necessity if you want to survive long-term and don't have a job, because most jobs don't even take paper applications, they require you to apply online. Not to mention a ton of companies requiring an email address to use their services, or use of their website to schedule appointments, or telemedicine to get in touch with a doctor if you don't have transportation to their office (or don't want to infect others, or get infected by others, while you're there due to other risk factors).

And you can't claim that there's competition in the ISP space and then claim that there's not because of a reason. There's clearly no competition in a lot of areas, and in the vast majority of areas there's maybe 2 or 3 options for providers. If you want to argue against why the government 'makes it difficult' for ISPs to build infrastructure, that's a whole separate issue that will be there whether ISPs are corporate or government-run, but there are a lot of safety issues and property rights issues that need to be dealt with either way.",1611189092.0,1

"&gt; So, how is censoring sedition any different than censoring pedophilia?

The production of pedophilia content actively harms an innocent child who has no way of protecting themself.  The production of seditious content does not harm innocent people.  

&gt; Also, how is private organizations refusing to do business with unsavory individuals even remotely close to preventing freedom of speech?  

Taken by itself, as a concept, it's not.  And both people and private organizations have a strong and legitimate interest in being able to decide who they do and do not do business with and what sort of content they host on servers they operate.  
However when the public square, where national discourse takes place, is privately owned, 1st Amendment rights can't simply be waived off with 'it's not the government doing the censoring'.  
Right now we have a situation where if you piss off 6 liberal guys from California (Jeff Bezos/Amazon, Sundar Pichai/Google, Satya Nadella/Microsoft, Tim Cook/Apple, Mark Zuckerberg/Facebook, Jack Dorsey/Twitter) and they legitimately (within their rights) decide to stop doing business with you, you are effectively off the Internet.  If those 6 guys think you don't have a right to speak, you lose the biggest web hosts, easy access to Android phones, ALL access to Apple phones, and any access to the audiences on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, &amp; Instagram.

Economical Structures are not Social structures and they adhere to vastly different rules and regulatory systems.

You just showed how uneducated you are comparing social rules to a economical system.

We live in a society that (most of the time, could be more) condemns violent actions against humans.
This also shows it self in rule sets like TOS or laws.
This has in no way something to do with ANY economic system. The issue here is that AWS Google and Apple seem to agree on the specific rule of the society in this case and dont want to work with an body that does not adhere to our basic rules.

"&gt; So what number of people do we need to reach so action can be taken? 

You should probably ask Amazon, Apple and Google this. I don't work there. If Facebook abandoned all moderation I hope they would get the boot as well. We have already seen places like Voat go offline as well. 

&gt; And you want Facebook to improve their moderation... on what basis? Who  is deciding what is and isn't acceptable? Not that they shouldn't have  moderation, but how would that have stopped these events? 

The company and their users decide what is acceptable by content guidelines and what users report and are willing to deal with. I'm willing to bet that Trump would have been banned long before the 6th if Twitter actually moderated what world leaders say on their platform and held them accountable since they had to explicitly start tagging his tweets saying they were lies. Same with the Iranian leader making anti-semetic comments on Twitter that should have been banned long ago. 

&gt; I don't think it makes it difficult at all. It just shifts people to  another community and likely will be more and more in the shadows rather  than having it more openly discussed. 

But the important part is that the community in the shadows will be harder to access. People are kind of stupid and if something is too difficult when it could be easier they won't go through with it. If for example, Facebook, wasn't as easy to use you wouldn't see people join it as much which leads to a smaller audience and while parts of that audience still wants to overthrow the government they are much smaller and don't have the ability to spread as much and gain traction. There will always be people that believe in terrible things but that doesn't mean we should give them the best tools possible to spread their ideologies around. 

&gt; That isn't true. Sound thought and speech can happen and you can still  have nut jobs doing nut job things. This wasn't even a fraction of the  populous... It was a lot of media hungry divas looking for attention.  Why people want to give these people so much credence is beyond me.

"There's no doubt about it, Apple saves on cost by not bundling the accessories.  This includes the cost of the accessories, the reduced box size, and even the shipping.  

However, in terms of environmental impact, the packaging is *extremely* insignificant as compared to the contents of the accessories.  It's almost entirely paper/cardboard packaging, with very little plastic.

I have yet to see anyone do a detailed analysis of how many people would need to buy the accessories separately to offset the environmental impact gains of including them for everyone, but there's no way it comes anywhere close to the number of people who will actually buy those accessories.

None of it is necessary at all for most of their customers.  In fact, for many years I haven't used any of it.  I've only used 3rd party chargers and cables.  If it wasn't for the AirPods, I'd be using 3rd party ones as well.

That's just it.  The bulk of their customers don't need all of this.  They aren't first time buyers, and even those may not want the Apple accessories.

Why?  Oh no... someone had to click or say yes to add the power cord... the horror!!!

&gt;If apple cared about environmental impact they would minimize waste by converting to the same cable(s) that literally every other company uses.

As much as I'd like to see Apple switch to USB-C, I can understand their reasons for not doing so, and I don't buy the argument that it would reduce waste.  You'd end up with a lot of people throwing out their old cables and Lightning based accessories when buying new iPhones, instead of using the ones they already have.

&gt;It also takes fairly minimal packaging material to just include them. Far less than having to open a separate package for each thing, if needed.

The packaging is actually minimal either way.  As I mentioned before, it's almost entirely just paper/cardboard.  The real impact is in the materials and manufacturing the the accessories themselves.

**Again, what actually are you complaining about?**  The effort is absolutely insignificantly trivial, and the cost is evaluated as the total cost.  That's a worst case scenario if one actually needs those accessories, and most people don't need all of them.

Really, this conversation has been 100 times the effort for you than *IF* you were to ever be in the situation of buying an iPhone.

"""Bundled"" = it came with the system and was built within the system in a way for the system to favor it over other browsers which would run much slower (anyone who used Netscape back then know what I'm talking about).

That's probably the lone difference between Apple's walled garden and Microsoft, that they don't likely overtly do anything to make other browser apps run slower, or whatnot. Microsoft didn't sell their own computers back then, so there was never the ""you force your OS onto your own machines"" bit that Apple does, but I think that would be arguably justified for a company to do.

That said, I do think a lot of their practices within iOS and the app store should be considered anti-competitive.

"CNN put out an article [How Trumpism explains the GameStop stock surge](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/27/politics/gamestop-stock-surge-trumpism/index.html). It is the most low effort, inaccurate, and clearly one-sided thing I've read all day.

&gt;... the amateurs began a coordinated effort of buying GameStop stock to drive its price higher and higher. (It's worth noting that Reddit was also a gathering spot for some of the most ardent Trump supporters in 2016.)

How dare people buy stocks we don't want them too! And is that really worth noting?

&gt;That effort to screw the pros... got an unexpected boost from none other than iconoclast-in-chief and Tesla founder Elon Musk, who tweeted ""Gamestonk!"" with a link to the ""wallstreetbets"" subreddit on Tuesday.

&gt;(Musk has also been a longtime critic of social media censoring and was a prominent Covid-19 skeptic. Sound like anyone else we know?)

Is that parenthetical relevant to this at all?

&gt;What's the end game for the GameStop surgers?... Because they don't really believe that GameStop is suddenly the new Amazon or Apple or Google. It's still mostly a business that derives its value from brick and mortar stores in malls. Which, again, is not exactly a big growth area in the coming years.

&gt;The point is that there is no real point beyond showing up the pros -- proving to them that they aren't as smart as they think they are and that they don't have the ability to control everything.

I bought my shares months ago when there was talk about a potential future for the business, before the Chewy guy came into the picture. No, I don't think it'll be the next Apple, but I saw it had potential. In fact, I have money in several companies I think will never rival Amazon, Apple, or Google. I own nothing of those 3.

&gt;Think of it this way: Giving someone the finger might make you feel good in the moment. But it doesn't solve anything.

"A short, simple version of what’s happening:
One guy, Mr. A speaks to another, Mr. B. Mr. A promises to pay back Mr. B for borrowing his apple and selling it for cheap at $5 (and then buying it back for cheaper at $1) and pay him money based on the difference between it.

So, Mr. A sells for $5, buys back for $1 and profits $4. He will give $3 to Mr. B and $1 to himself as a cut.

Now think of that, but on a massive scale. That’s what’s happening atm. The hedge funds sold a ton of shares for cheap, and were expecting to buy them back for cheaper - - but some pea-brained geniuses in a subreddit decided to say “Fuck you, greedy pigs.” And bought all of the cheap stocks, causing a rise in price for the stocks that the hedge funds had to buy. 

Back to the example: Mr. A MUST buy back what he borrowed from Mr. B. Meaning that if the apple he sold for $5 was now $10, he had to buy it regardless, facing a loss in profit because the price was greater than what he sold it from.

Now back to irl. Those hedge funds have to buy back those insanely risen stocks (now $200+) that they sold at $4 no matter what. 

That’s how they’re losing all the money they’ve earned, because they bit off more than they can chew.",1611828579.0,1

"In this case, they did not borrow the stock first, they sold naked calls. 

Imagine if a bag of apples costs 5 dollars. Normally with options, you buy the 5 dollar bag of apples FIRST and THEN you can sell someone a promise (option) that you will sell them your bag of apples for 5 dollars at any time within the next 90 days. If the price of apples goes up then the option holder will ask for that 5 dollar bag of apples so they can run to the market and sell them for more and pocket the difference. This is known as a ""covered call""—you own the apples and sell a promise. 

A naked call is when I don't buy the bag of apples first. I just sell you the promise to buy the apples at 5 bucks. If the price of apples goes down I get to keep the money you paid me for the promise. However, if the price of the apple goes to 10 dollars I have to run to the store, buy the bag of apples for 10 bucks so I can then fulfill my promise to sell you the apples for 5 dollars, which you will then sell right back to the market at 10 dollars—then pocket the 5 dollar profit. 

So that's a little sketchy but it gets worse. Imagine there are only 100 bags of apples in existence in your small town. What the hedge fund people did is they sold naked calls on 129 bags of apples. Again they never owned the apples but most importantly they have sold promises to 29 bags of apples that's don't even exist. They of course did this because they were convinced that the price of apples would go down and they would keep the money for the promisies. The big problem now is that those bags of apples today cost over $300 each AND they can't even find enough apples so there's a feedback loop where the apples just keep getting more expensive. 

So, it's not so much that they shorted the stock. It's that they sold things they didn't own and they sold things that didn't even exist and now they are in big trouble.",1611844575.0,1

"&gt; Would the stock actually have to have 700 trillion in it...

Market cap is nothing more than the share price times the number of shares that exist.  In theory it's what it would cost to buy 100% of the shares and own the company outright.  But of course it's unlikely that anyone would actually be able to execute on buying 70 million shares from hundreds of thousands of owners at a given price.  So really it's more of a shorthand to let us talk about what a company is worth moment to moment.

But there's not a bank account somewhere with all that money sitting in it.   It's just a number that results from a formula.   It's a handy gauge for whether assumptions about a company's value are realistic.   (Gamestop being worth 30x the entire output of the USA for a year is *definitely* not realistic.  Or a more apples to apples comparison: Apple Computer's market cap is $2.3 trillion, could Gamestop possibly ever be worth 304 times as much as Apple?  Can you imagine Gamestop acquiring Apple?)",1611880621.0,1
"(By the way I was off by a factor of 1000 when I did the math on the Gamestop market cap, it's $700 *billion*, not trillion.)

&gt; But how would apple be bought out by gamestop if no one wants to buy that many shares to give them capital?

One way this might happen without having to sell shares to raise cash is a ""stock swap"".  Gamestop would negotiate to swap X shares of AAPL for Y shares of GME.  After the buyout completes, anyone who previously held AAPL shares now instead owns some number of GME shares.   To make this work Gamestop would have to own enough of their own shares to give them to the people who previously held Apple shares.

Usually companies do own a majority of their own shares, because if they didn't then someone outside the company could buy a majority stake and effectively control the company.   So they've got shares available to trade away in exchange for some other company.  Apple shareholders would be happy, because they now have typically more valuable shares in the bigger company.  And Apple the company and all of its assets and liabilities would now be entirely owned by Gamestop.

Of course for this to happen the majority of the people who held shares in Apple would have to agree that they would prefer to have (overvalued) shares of Gamestop instead, which isn't ever going to happen in this specific example.",1611883569.0,1

"My bet is they never bring this to trial; they are trying to paint Facebook as some type of underdog and Apple as some Goliath who is abusing their market position; they are relying on the small fact that some of Apple's actions at least from the outside are just that. Their goal is to get the government to side with them in the hope that Apple will change their polices to better align with Facebook's bottom line. However Facebook has one very big problem and that is their success relies on their users data, and Apple has figured out a way to make a lot of money off doing the exact opposite (or at the very least appearing to), and to make matters worse for Facebook Apple has gotten the public to go along with them. Facebook knows that by bringing this to trial the best they can hope for is for Apple to apply the same rules on themselves as they do to those companies that operate on the Apple platform (which will change little to nothing because for the most part that is already the case) and possibly not include some applications by default, but Apple will be able to successfully argue that Messages is a core function of the phone so that'll be a big loss for Facebook. So their goal is to stir the pot and hope that can get some members of the government to play along with their charade and maybe open up an anti-trust investigation into Apple, all while ignoring the fact that what Facebook is doing is far worse and that Facebook's action are not in the public's best interests. I'm going to go out on the limb and say that Facebook started this back in the summer of 2020 and was banking on Trump winning a second term which would have given them a more ""friendly"" government ally.

Google stopped responding to Gizmodo’s emails after that inquiry.

People, read the article. All we can conclude from this is at this time, it's a system in place the prevent review bombing. Review bombing is a real thing where you can pay entities to use a farm of illegitimate negative reviews to tank competitive apps. Google (and Apple, check Robin Hood on their store - same thing) protects against that ""behavior"" and suppresses it so that competitors can't attack each other's reviews and send their competitors to the depths of the app store. The automatic system picks this up as ""inorganic"" that's what the article has quoted from the Google spokes person. They didn't comment any further (above their pay grade). Beyond that, people are leaving illegitimate negative reviews (those who download the app for 2 seconds just to review current events). Just wait a few days and keep posting your negative reviews (if you actually use the app and are negatively reviewing it legitimately). And you will see them show up. It's not a corporate censorship collusion conspiracy. It's just a valid system in place to protect (even small time) developers.",1611944552.0,-1

"TL;DR: Apple are making new tracking rules they claim are about user privacy that will *not* stop ads from using your data to target you. They will actually just move advertising dollars from Facebook and Google into Apple, because *Apple is now the only party allowed to know everything about a user* (aka, no ‘third party’ tracking).

I think users should be able to opt out of tracking, but if they do it should be applied to all companies equally. Apple is absolutely being two faced about this. Their new rule is ‘company B cannot track users between company C and company D.’ But what none of these articles say is that Apple itself is absolutely free to track every user across all apps, because Apple is not a ‘third party.’ They are *already doing this* to power their own recently launched ads product.

"&gt; Apple launched their own competing ads product just about six months before this announcement.

What, the Apple Search Ads? Hardly a competing product, more like a niche product. Also, the privacy statement reads:

&gt; Apple Search Ads doesn’t buy or share users’ personal information with other companies. We don’t track people by linking user or device data collected from Apple apps with user or device data collected from third parties for advertising targeting or measurement. And we don’t share user or device data with data brokers.

Of course you may say that they are lying, but in that case they could lie about everything and the entire discussion is moot.

&gt; Also ‘no third party tracking’ really just means ‘first party (Apple)’ is now the only entity that has access to all of the ‘second party (literally every app on every iphone ever)’ data. 

No it doesn't mean that. It doesn't imply anything about what Apple does or does not access.

&gt; They already use that data to target you with ads.

For Apple Search Ads, yes:

&gt; Apple-delivered advertising helps people discover apps, products, and services while respecting user privacy. To deliver personalized ads, Apple uses information about you to serve ads that are more relevant to you. You can learn more about the information Apple uses to serve advertisements to you while protecting your privacy. If you don't want to receive personalized ads, you can choose to turn off the Personalized Ads setting on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, and Mac.

"It's actually not debatable at all. The reason they aren't paying taxes isn't because they claim it's generated else where, it's because they are offsetting the income in Europe with bullshit intracompany IP expenses and licensing in a tax haven.

Google and Apple most certainly do owe taxes on services sold in Europe, but they sell the service through their local subsidiary, and that local subsidiary has to pay the tax haven subsidiary a ""licensing fee"" which convenient offsets the entire income.  

1. Google transfers IP to Google Ireland.  
2. Google Ireland licenses that IP to Google High Tax France for $5B.  
3. Google High Tax France generates $5B in income, but has a $5B IP expenses.  
4. Google Ireland generates $5B in income from the licensing fee and pays tax haven rates on it (i.e. no tax).  

So what you have is shifting profits to a tax haven through bullshit IP licensing sales that are all intracompany. They are creating fake expenses just to move the income to the location where there is no tax. It would be like you earning money in the US, but then setting up a company in the Ireland that sends you a bullshit invoice and no you claim you made no money because you had to pay it all to Ireland... even though you own the Irish company who invoiced you.

18.6%. If you're going to round, do it correctly and put it at 19.

And while the only remaining point you're sticking to is one that's arguably a matter of opinion rather than fact (making your position somewhat defendable), I would *bet* that if your laptop and phone were 19% fatter, you would not consider that to be ""slight"". For that matter, if the next Galaxy Watch was 19% thicker, I doubt that would pass muster for you either.

But, ultimately, it comes down to my original comment that ""Not everyone wants a huge watch."" Any watch maker who wants mainstream success should support a variety of different sizes so as to account for all the customers out there - male, female, thick wristed and slight wristed.

However, even if they did, I think it would be highly unlikely it would be practical on a modern smartphone and have *no* doubt it would never work on something as small and space constrained as a smartwatch, particularly with the screen in the way on the top and the health sensors in the way on the bottom.

"Levels of risk, low-to-high:

1. Cash in the bank, unto the government insured limit. Premium bonds

5. Blue chip stock - shares in very large companies, S&amp;P 500, FTSE 100 **&lt;-- you are here**

6. Small cap stock (e.g. shares in Gamestock itself), emerging markets stock

7. Hedge funds

Note that you reduce risk by diversification, so an S&amp;P 500 index fund is lower risk than just buying stock in Apple alone. Hedge funds will comprise a *tiny* proportion of any pension fund.

"How does someone short selling a company make it more difficult to raise capital?

Short selling has literally no effect on the company that the ""normal"" buying and selling of the stock does not have. Short selling does not make it more difficult to raise capital; the company's financials and business outlook make it difficult to raise capital.

Hell, let's pretend that Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk team up to take the world's largest short position against Apple with 100% of their combined net worth right now. Jeff and Elon borrow Apple stock from current stockholders and then sell that stock to other people who want to buy that Apple stock. Does that transaction make it more likely for Apple to go bankrupt? Does that transaction make it more difficult for Apple to raise capital? 

Of course it doesn't; Apple is still Apple. They will sell as many iPhones, MacBook Pros, and apps from the App Store after Jeff and Elon take their short positions as they were going to sell before Jeff and Elon took their short position. Pretend you are a normal person who just dropped their iPhone 7 in the toilet, so you need to buy a new phone. Are you going to not buy a new iPhone because Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk think Apple stock is overvalued?

If it was as simple as ""just short the company and you can magically hasten them going out of business,"" don't you think that competitors of struggling companies would be continually shorting their stock as an easy way to speed up the decline of their competitors while also making money? Why don't companies do that? Because it is ludicrous.

If that is really how it worked, why the hell would **an owner of the company that someone is trying to short** willingly lend someone their shares in that company so they could short the stock? Remember, **the person who lends the stock to the person taking a short position will get the shares of stock back eventually**. If the stock shares are worth $0 when the lender gets them back, the lender loses money. In fact, the lender has lost 100% of their money invested in that stock (minus the interest paid on the loaned shares). No one would ever allow their shares to be borrowed if shorting a stock was a way to ""hasten"" bankruptcy. ""Sure, borrow my shares of this company have money invested in, I was really hoping someone would come along and hasten bankruptcy for them. I was getting really tired of not losing my investment fast enough!"" said no one ever. The person borrowing the shares bets that the shares will be lower at some point in the slightly immediate future. The person lending the shares bets that when the loaned shares are repaid, the share price at that time + the interest received on the loaned shares will be worth more than if they sold the shares at the current price; in other words, they think that at worst, the share price will only slightly decrease and will hopefully increase during that time because that means that not only did their original investment pay off, but they got paid extra money (the interest) for owning something they already wanted to own.

Why did these hedge funds have massive shorts in GameStop? GameStop's shares were worth $4/share; that means the **maximum** amount of money the hedge funds could have made was $4/share. You don't get rich from a maximum upside of $4/share. Hell, you could short Amazon, Apple, or any other company and make more than $4/share on that short since those companies' share price is likely to swing that much in intraday trading. The hedge funds shorted GameStop because they massive long positions in other brick and mortar retailers. If their bet that the retail sector is a good place to invest money right now is wrong, then *hedging* their bet means taking a position that will make money if the sector sees a decline. 

In other words, if they think that Walmart, Target, Costco, Best Buy, etc., are good companies to invest in right now, what is a company in that sector that they could that would be disproportionally affected by a downturn in the retail sector? Perhaps a brick and mortar retailer that sells only discretionary products, is struggling financially and has financially strong competitors (Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Costco, Amazon, etc.), and going to have to deal with newly released products, that are essential to the items that retailer sells, that are also likely to result in a paradigm shift in the way consumers purchase the products that they sell? 

Suppose your boss came to you and said that you were going to play a game. He would give you a brokerage account with $10,000,000 in it, and you were in charge of investing it for the next 3 years. At the end of 3 years, you keep every dollar in the account greater than $10,000,000, but you are fired if the account has less than $10,000,000 in it at the end of 3 years. The only requirements were you had to take three long positions in brick and mortar retailers and one short position in a brick and mortar retailer. Which publically traded brick and mortar retailer would you choose to take the short position in? 

Remember, you need to pay interest on the shares you borrow to short, so picking a terrible company or one with a high share price will result in you paying more interest and eating into your potential for the $10,000,000 to grow. You don't want to pick a company that is doing really well because while the interest you pay will be super cheap, your maximum profit/share is the current share price (minus interest) while your maximum losses are unlimited.

Shorting to short and hoping to get rich is a horrible prospect. When you take a long position, your maximum loss is capped (the amount of money you invest), and your maximum gain is unlimited. When you take a short position, your maximum gain is capped (at the current price/share), and your maximum losses are unlimited. No one shorts stocks/indexes to get massively rich, and it is super hard to take a short position to get massively rich unless you have inside information or do a ton of research to discover a major flaw or non-correctable point of failure in a company/system before anyone else discovers it. If you were able to discover a fundamental and unfixable flaw with all current and future potential Apple products that was so bad that they would face massive lawsuits for past products and would be unable to ever sell another product in the future, you could get massively rich. Betting that a struggling company worth $4/share won't be around if the retail sector takes a downturn is not the epitome of greed; it's a fairly logical bet that could make you $4/share you owe or lose you unlimited money if you are wrong.

Shorting is done to mitigate losses, not make insanely large gains.",1612207457.0,1

But even worse is Apple removing the VPN services in China.   Making it more difficult for China customers to protect themselves.

"As I've written in another comment, I'm all for moderation in reviews so that spam gets removed. This should be done by humans or at least the automatic system should only kick-in for super clear cases of bot brigading or spam; anything else should pop-up on the screen of an actual employee at google or steam or apple and they should create a case and actually determine if the reviews should be removed..which is exactly the opposite of what happens now, now they get removed instantly and maybe reinstated if people make enough noise and convince the company in question to look into the fact. Basically, consumer voice is silenced by default, and whatever bullshit X company does is only reflected by reviews days later when it's already irrelevant and they have probably gotten away with it. Just think about all videogames that get launched in a great state but then microtransactions get added after the fact so that they don't appear in professional reviews, or games that get broken by an update and the devs then take months to fix it. I can bring even the example of my phone (I have a oneplus 6), it used to run great but the update to android 10 completely botched it and now it's full of bugs and runs like shit when one of those kicks in and makes it lag super bad..I have zero recourse against this as a consumer, and professional reviews are still online calling the phone ""the best buy of 2018"". When something like this happens users need to have the right to review bomb the product so that their voice is actually heard..I couldn't do anything about my phone aside from posting on the official forums where it got completely ignored because it's not public facing, and 13 months later my phone still runs like garbage and all the features that have been broken with that december 2019 update are still broken (for example, long exposure photos don't work, recording video lags and the files is saved WITH the lags still there, photos sometimes are not saved, the phone lags and hangs, sometimes the screen becomes unresponsive until you turn it on and off,...)",1612280285.0,-1

They’ve innovated dramatically in the space, including logistics, data, and ecosystem building and have basically shortcut the need for physical retail in the country because they adopted e-commerce early and have grown significantly. China is also a leader in manufacturing of green tech, EV research, and is building world class transport systems.

"Keyhole surgery is absolutely an innovation because it is a part of daily life for a whole lot of people.

I’m not measuring just what is sold, that’s a bit of a strawman. What I am saying is that manufacturing something, itself and not necessarily for the purpose of making a sale, is that extremely innovation intensive...such as packaging lots of available technologies into a manufacturable product, aka smartphone.

This is not socialism. You can have capitalism and social welfare. Countries like Sweden are capitalist and have free markets while also having lots of social welfare. These things are not exclusive to each other and can coexist without needing a shift to an entirely different ideology that does not exactly have a very good track record with success. Things like child labor, sweatshops etc.. are issues right now, but they were also issues in current developed countries like the U.S., UK, France .. the list goes on.

RPiOS can’t vouch for Microsoft’s repository because they don’t maintain it and it’s not in their upstream. It’s literally a third party repository. It should not be enabled by default, even if the distro developers personally think it’s a great repository. It certainly should not be stealth added during an update. At most, there should be an option during installation asking the user if they want to add recommended third-party repositories like Microsoft.

Great, so when will you be done with this process? Because we kind of need to stop climate change, and it would be great if we didn't have to go through literally every country on the planet before we get to that.

Furthermore, how are you expecting to eradicate poverty by spreading an economic system built on extracting money from local economies, and then just keeping it, completely killing the [velocity of money?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/velocity.asp)

&gt; Plus lets not pretend that child labor is exclusive to capitalism. Many ""socialist"" countries have had issues with child labor.

Oh sure. If you started listing off countries that have engaged in this shit, which because of our global economy is pretty much everyone, I'd denounce all of them. Bolivia even had a socialist (actual socialist, no quote marks) president for 13 years, but if we started digging we could find shit on them. Bad things are bad regardless of who does them.

&gt; I am sure as a person I would probably agree with you on many things, but I disagree with the ideology you choose to follow pretty much entirely when it comes to how they want to achieve what they want to achieve. End of the day I would hope most people want whats best for the world with different ideas on how to get there.

Oh sure, and that goes both ways. I could never even imagine getting rid of corporate and capital gains taxes while we still have capitalism. But that doesn't mean we can't agree on some things when it comes to electoralism. We could probably after some negotiations come to agree on for example directing resources towards fixing up climate change - considering how climate change will literally, unironically, murder capitalism if left unchecked.

&gt; Also it is not Neo-colonialism. I don't understand how a company like apple opening a factory in Vietnam is seen as a bad thing by you.

Oh I'm not. But while we're at it, how about they pay a fair market price for the labor, and they didn't start the factory there simply to escape labor protection laws in another country.

Oh and they should pay for the pollution they'll produce, and for any damages to the local environment they'll do.

And make sure they don't pay off any local politicians in order to make the local laws more suitable.

&gt; they can further develop their economy to the point where the quality of life for their citizens grows significantly. Look at China. Look at South Korea. The life quality of their citizens has so significantly words can hardly describe how much they have benefited from free markets.

Quality of life is heavily based on your material conditions. If you're working 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, and living and sleeping at the factory (like rural Chinese workers that come to factories in locations like Guangzhou do), your material conditions are just straight up junk.

If we look at how those conditions were improved in the ""West"", it was through labor organizing and workers parties. Though I don't think China will go that way, they're an authoritarian nightmare.

And one point. Free markets are not a feature of capitalism, that's a separate issue. There is nothing about workers owning their workplace that inherently restricts trade between companies. Chairs will be produced and sold, regardless of who owns the chair factory.",1612799689.0,1

Same for tech workers.

&amp;#x200B;

While everyone seems to think unions are good because pay increases, what they fail to consider is the overall cost this has across the board.

For a company like Amazon, unions will cost customers more money. The ""standard of living"" salary is rarely the goal for unions, because the more money you make, the more money they make.

Unions have a financial stake to get you more money and everyone knows companies don't pay this.

Customers do.

On the flip side, unions have lead to improved working conditions, though largely indirectly rather than directly.

Companies pay attention to what's going on, and if Company A gets unionized and ends up suffering because of it, Company B will make changes to prevent unionization.

In an non-coincidental situation, it is always very large companies that are usually pushed into unionization.

This is because most larger companies go public during their growth, which means stockholders call the shots, not companies.

Employees become a line item on balance sheets, one in which every stockholder wants removed from them. Employees ruin profits, but are a necessary evil.

Keeping them happy is not a priority. Getting them at 120% production is, and this is tipping point unions start to gain momentum.

It's a trade-off, like everything else. Of course, everyone should earn a comfortable wage based on the work they do. Company executives, however, don't care about this stuff. They just want to see higher profits and more investors.

Companies like Amazon, Google, and Apple have valuations worth billions, but not a single cent of this valuation is about the employee.

All this gets ruined with unions, and customers pay the bills.

Not happy Amazon workers are going to unionize, but I don't fault them.

I do think when professional athletes and Hollywood go on strike, they are often portrayed as entitled and whiny by the media (fair or not - I am sure there are some totally valid complaints as well). I do think having unions being represented by Hollywood, athletes, and big tech will put off a lot of Middle America, which ultimately hurts the movement... but that's my opinion, and you've made a decent argument that it won't. I can't really refute your point, as I am just speculating on possible perception myself. There is a lot of propaganda out there either way, and maybe it's wise to not worry myself with whether I will become part of that like you said. I am not opposed to big tech having unions, I am more opposed to the idea that this should be considered a high priority, or put another way - that it is equally as necessary for big tech as some of the other groups I've mentioned. 

&gt; People hate big tech companies, not big tech workers. There's already been case studies of this in union drives at big tech companies and none of what you just said has happened.

I think a lot of people truly do hate big tech workers. Seeing the Capital being stormed makes me thankful I am working remotely. Big Tech employees are blamed for gentrification and high rent all the time. General rhetoric against ""the 1%"" applies to a fair portion of employees here. Even if you don't consider any of that hate, I think the public opinion would be even lower if they knew exactly what we got, and what we get ""mad"" about. One thing that most of these companies do is have Q&amp;A sessions with the executives where people basically get to ask snarky questions to billionaires without consequence. ""Why does FB get $2000 for their home office, but we only get $1000!?"" or ""Why do does google get Monday AND Tuesday off to relax, but we only get Monday?!"" Don't get me wrong, I appreciate those perks, and I like that we as a group fight for great perks. I just feel like it's one thing if we all vote on something like that, and get our way, and another when it becomes something I am obligated to strike for it (or some other union-sanctioned move). I feel like if our demands are publicly stated, we'll look like entitled brats... because, well, we are. 

&gt; What it would do is again, about you. You're not going to lose anything, your company can't lower your pay without your consent after unionizing. You start at the level you're on and you negotiate from there.

This is a good way to put it. Maybe I'm short-sighted, but I feel like what I've got is great. And paying ~$3000/year (assuming the dues would be about 1%) to ""keep it"" feels like it would be a waste. Working at a big tech company gives you the mobility to switch jobs pretty easily. If my company started to suck, I could just work somewhere else. **That** is the check we have on our employer as opposed to collective bargaining. And if you think it's inferior to being in a union, then why do we have literally the best perks of any industry in the country? Now, yeah, maybe things will decline down the road, and I'll wish I had a union to fight for me. Is there some compelling reason to ""get in early"" versus just waiting for things to need changes? I am not really making the argument that it won't help, it's more that I am not persuaded by any of the evidence claiming it will - aka ""don't fix what isn't broken""

&gt; As a union organizer, I can tell you that everything you just described would make your workforce an organizers dream. I've met with so many phenomenally stupid people I was trying to organize. Plus, having folks like you would help incentivize folks like call center employees, IT, etc to come on. There are an awful lot of folks in that sector and having the leaders decide that they need a union would help the folks making 40k not feel the same sort of things you're feeling. I've had people making 19 an hour with no benefits and 4 teeth tell me that I should be focusing on people making 12 who only have 3 teeth.

This is an interesting point, and something I will keep in mind and think about more. I realize my $3k+ dues would go a lot further than someone else's $400, plus it would mean they could even waive more fees for others who can't afford them. If joining a union is about me donating a portion of my compensation to support less well-compensated employees, then I feel like that's how it should be presented. It is often presented as a way for me to fight for better conditions for myself. If it's about me, then I don't need it. If it would help others who are struggling, I would consider it. I don't like how it's presented as a panacea to all work-related problems. 

&gt;I've never seen a union contract wherein everyone is paid the same. I've seen plenty where there are 50 different pay groups, though.

Fair enough, the context of me saying that was in response to this in the original comment I replied to: 

&gt;Unionising at Google was brought up due to pay inequality between men and woman

If pay inequality between men and women is an issue, then why not between other people with the same level, responsibilities, and performance? I am in the higher end of pay for my level because I was able to leverage a competitive counter offer. Let's say you worked at Tesla before the stock boomed, and a unionized tech company wanted to hire you. If the company you want to work for has to be ""fair"" then they can't hire you at an inflated rate. I want to be able to exploit this, and I am pretty sure the other savvy people here want to as well. I would be concerned that any sort of compensation-fixing could be used to depress income across the board in the interest of ""fairness."" It's a lot easier to set caps than it is to give the bottom 70% huge raises to make things the same (and again, these people we are helping are still compensated better than most Americans). If there is a pay difference based on protected status, then that is illegal. We don't need a union to fix that issue, we need the government to enforce the laws, right? If Apple was utilizing child labor, the answer wouldn't be to form a union so that we could strike, it would be to report them to the government and prosecute them. 

&gt; The question you need to ask is what you would want it to do.

Yeah, and I have tried to think of some way this could benefit me, and I've come up empty. All the other stuff - like fighting for lower-paid employees and contractors is something I think we can do without paying dues. We literally make memes about the shit that bothers us, then ask our respective CEOs to fix it. It's like a really stupid petition, but it seems pretty effective at both grabbing attention of the workers and getting results.

Think about someone you admire, someone you feel has made all the right moves. As much as you feel like middle America hates you, and some do, the predominant feeling isn't hate, it's jealousy. I know, I talk to these people for a living. They want to be like you, and they feel frustrated that even though they feel like they've made the right moves, they haven't gotten what you did. 

If you and people like you said that even you needed to come together, people would see that and realize that they need to get on that same page. 
&gt;I think a lot of people truly do hate big tech workers. Seeing the Capital being stormed makes me thankful I am working remotely. Big Tech employees are blamed for gentrification and high rent all the time.

Yup. And unfortunately a lot of that is true. Straight up, having a bunch of you guys move in sucks for a lot of others in that area. It's certainly not your fault, but it is a consequence of you being around. I'm not gonna lie to you here. 

However, being part of a union would give you the ability to make change in where your company chooses to locate new operations. Imagine if a ton of you stood up and protested against a proposed expansion of your company into an area that would harm the community there. Wouldn't your company retaliate? With a union, in every contract I've read (*and I've read literally hundreds*) they can't. 
&gt; General rhetoric against ""the 1%"" applies to a fair portion of employees here. ...(character limit)... Don't get me wrong, I appreciate those perks, and I like that we as a group fight for great perks. 

You get those perks because you make that fucking company work. They would be lost without you. The old saying ""my boss makes a dollar I make a dime"" still works when your boss makes a million dollars and you make a million dimes. 
&gt;I just feel like it's one thing if we all vote on something like that, and get our way, and another when it becomes something I am obligated to strike for it (or some other union-sanctioned move). I feel like if our demands are publicly stated, we'll look like entitled brats... because, well, we are. 

**Nobody** is obligated to strike. Ever. Strikes are always, by law, voted on by the membership going on strike. Even then, I can't make folks my union represents go on strike even if their co-workers voted for it. Though I will judge anyone who crosses any picket line, ever. In my union, 98% of contracts are settled without strike, and most strikes don't last very long. 

&gt;This is a good way to put it. Maybe I'm short-sighted, but I feel like what I've got is great. And paying ~$3000/year (assuming the dues would be about 1%) to ""keep it"" feels like it would be a waste. 

Dues are never paid until *after* your contract is signed. That means that unless you guys as a group vote on a contract that gives you nothing extra, you're guaranteed to make more than your dues would cost you. How much that's actually going to cost you depends on the union, and since mine isn't super interested in tech (we're looking more at the kind of lower end blue collar types) I can't tell you how much your dues would be. 
&gt;Working at a big tech company gives you the mobility to switch jobs pretty easily. If my company started to suck, I could just work somewhere else. **That** is the check we have on our employer as opposed to collective bargaining. And if you think it's inferior to being in a union, then why do we have literally the best perks of any industry in the country? 

Because your industry is phenomenally profitable. You make a trillion dollar industry work. A warehouse worker can move to a different warehouse, but they can be replaced by some temp. How many people could do your job? That's your power. Now imagine if 100 of you moved as a block, how much more power would you have?
&gt;Now, yeah, maybe things will decline down the road, and I'll wish I had a union to fight for me.

I am not really making the argument that it won't help, it's more that I am not persuaded by any of the evidence claiming it will - aka ""don't fix what isn't broken""

It is broken. It always is. You aren't getting as large a slice of the pie as you deserve. Difference between you and the warehouse guy is that your pie was much larger to begin with.

I specifically didn't present it that way because I despise unions who make their decisions based on how it'll affect their bottom line. We're here to help people, not to make money. 

Imagine you live in a dictatorship. Would democracy solve all your problems? Of course not, but it would solve some of them. So people fight and die to replace the dictators with representative government. You work in a dictatorship. Union workers don't. 


&gt;&gt;Unionising at Google was brought up due to pay inequality between men and woman

I'd bet good money that's just messaging. I'm sure that's a problem there, but it's probably not what most of the unionizing workers are hoping to change. It's just the item that they're hoping to change that will get the public on their side. A lot of union organizing is essentially working as a very, very low paid PR consultant. 
&gt;If pay inequality between men and women is an issue, then why not between other people with the same level, responsibilities, and performance? I am in the higher end of pay ...(character limit)... It's a lot easier to set caps than it is to give the bottom 70% huge raises to make things the same (and again, these people we are helping are still compensated better than most Americans).

If I were setting up a union for you guys I wouldn't base it on the sort of blue collar contract that sets wages based on seniority. I would set it up more like the WGA/SAG/NFLPA/etc contracts function. Each employee does most of the pay negotiations on their own (perhaps with union help), but the union negotiates everything else, including benefits (You make way more than I do, but I'd bet good money my health care is better than yours), working conditions, residual payments, etc. 

Honest question here, to which I legitimately don't know the answer, if you write a piece of software that's used for ten years, and keeps making money the whole time, do they keep paying you? I suspect not. Why shouldn't they? If a TV writer makes a character, they're paid every time that guy is seen because their union contract forces their employer to compensate them. Why shouldn't you get similar terms?
&gt; If there is a pay difference based on protected status, then that is illegal. We don't need a union to fix that issue, we need the government to enforce the laws, right? If Apple was utilizing child labor, the answer wouldn't be to form a union so that we could strike, it would be to report them to the government and prosecute them. 

Unions stopped child labor by forcing the government to create and enforce laws. Labor laws are great, but they're worth nothing if people are afraid to report their employer for breaking them, or if the consequences are so worthless that fines are just a cost of business. 

&gt; and I have tried to think of some way this could benefit me, and I've come up empty. All the other stuff - like fighting for lower-paid employees and contractors is something I think we can do without paying dues. We literally make memes about the shit that bothers us, then ask our respective CEOs to fix it. It's like a really stupid petition, but it seems pretty effective at both grabbing attention of the workers and getting results. 

There's something about your job you would change. There's something that bothers you. *All of it* is on the table. What is it for you?
&gt;Anyway, I really do appreciate your reply. I know this is getting long, but I will say that you've given me some things to think about.

It is not a perfect analogy, but I think it is similar to the sort of thinking that leads to the word of a police officer being taken as automatic truth in a courtroom, where the defense lawyer must then work to break down that credibility rather than this human who has the job of police officer says that he saw A, B, and C, and here is some evidence backing that up that can be questioned.

&gt; A Swedish entrepreneur and owner of a registered trademark for the term CLUBHOUSE has accused the rapidly-growing social network app Clubhouse - which has garnered fans including Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg - of spuriously seeking the removal of his app from marketplaces.

&gt; In the same month, Tesla CEO Elon Musk promoted the app following an appearance on it, which spurred the app&amp;#039;s rapid growth in recent weeks - including invitations being sold for upwards of $100. Currently the app is only available on Apple&amp;#039;s iOS store, with a Google Play app in the works.

&gt; Talking to WTR, serial entrepreneur Alexander Frederiksen - who has helped develop consumer apps including TanTan, a Chinese dating app - states that he launched his Clubhouse app on the Apple iOS store and Google Play store in mid-2020.

This is an issue that expands to the entire heavy equipment industry. John Deere, CNH Industrial (CASE CE, IH, New Holland, etc.), AGCO (a parent company of multiple farming heavy equipment brands), JCB, CAT, Takeuchi, (along with many more), and as well as various engine makers (Isuzu, Yanmar, Deutz, Kubota, etc.) for these brands are all tied into this system design that requires expensive specialty tools and software to perform basic diagnostics.    
    
Oh, you got a fault code? You probably can't identify it. Unless you own the service manual for the machines you own, but no dealership will sell you that. So you call the dealership that has these tools so they can charge you a fuckton of money even though all you needed was some cheap relay. Essentially, you're paying a premium for a part replacer. This happens often when it comes to the electronics they've slapped these machines with.    
    
It's even worse for any machines that are a little older. Plenty of machines made in the 2000s are declared obsolete and no longer have the diagnostic software or specialty tools available, not even the dealer has it because the manufacturer has ganked it so dealerships can sell newer machines. It's the biggest display of ""welp, that was a big fucking waste of money"" you'll ever see when you're standing in front of one.

"Are you European? You have that distinctly European flavor of snobbery and rudeness. You see, the distinct part comes from being particularly rude and insulting, while also being very much in the wrong. It's a deadly combination. 

Anyways, I'll explain it to you. First of all, free speech is a concept. The 1st Amendment is a separate concept. These companies are not abiding by the spirit of free speech, but they are not violating the law.

Secondly, you say other publishing vectors exist. As evidenced by the past few months, these companies often operate in Lockstep. For example, 2 private American companies dictate every App Store in the world (Google and Apple). Social media is a little more diverse, but is heading down the same path. Companies like Facebook own multiple platforms like Instagram, Messenger, and Facebook. There's only a few big players, and similarly, many of these players operate in lockstep with one another. In fact, executives from these companies have testified to even discussing their plans on what to ban together. And this lockstep is spreading. Now, website hosts, email platforms, and more are all getting in on the silencing. If every category of publishing vector starts to ban people, then *you should be* scared.

Thirdly, other publishing vectors are dying out. Print Media is gone. And other vectors that used to be more simple are becoming complicated. For example, a simple blog needs a myriad of different private companies to give you the ""ok"".

"The issue isn’t one of power imo it’s also one of pr. It’s not so much which is technically able to do what to hurt the other, it’s who can successfully frame whatever action they’re taking (honestly or not) as being altruistic for the consumer. Apple is making the first move and its one that is unambiguously beneficial to consumers. They decide what to do with their data. 

If Facebook wants to “make Apple pay” they need to figure out something that can be done in a way that doesn’t make them look like the villain. For an extreme example, if they take their app off iOS, that’s a horrible, horrible look. It’s saying they depend on selling your data without your consent to such an extent that they will make using their own product much harder for their own users if they have to in order to punish another company. Yeah, a lot of people are hooked on Facebook and will choose it over Apple devices maybe, but a lot of people also value Apple devices over Facebook use and will go from poking around now and then “active users” to not.

If the goal is the product, you wind up making more money.

And your assertion that Apple wants to make their data more valuable is coming out of your ass. If you want to come up with a theory at least make it believable. The truth is, Facebook has no right to your data to begin with, so Apple doesn’t need any reason at all. For me or for you.

Child labor, stealing tech from companies then tying it up in court battles. The huge amount of environmental waste they cause by changing one small aspect of their product making previous items obsolete(air pods anyone, 3.5mm jack). Fighting any form of unionization, or workers right in the US. Also fighting to not allow standardization of charging ports, which in turn would cut down on environmental waste, claiming it will stifle innovation which is a lie. Jobs and other tech ceos colluded with each other to keep engineers pay down.

"It’s not the iTunes or the iMessage but rather the ecosystem. Stuff simply works. 

I don’t have to worry about my device and my OS being two separate platforms. They are very well integrated.

That seamless integration is true for the Apple platform in general. There’s continuity between all Apple devices. For calls, browsers, and even biometric integration where you can pay on your Mac or iPad from your phone.

I also feel that Apple has a higher bar for apps and the quality of apps is a lot better. 

Plus, from a security perspective iPhones are much more straightforward to push and manage device management policies. I work on Wall Street and almost no major bank supports Android for any monitored employee. Part of the reason is also frequent updates to the platform. 

Then there’s the question of third party software. Oh you’re buying a Samsung? There’s Samsung crap. You are buying Huawei? Maybe there’s spyware. You simply don’t have to deal with any of that.

Then there’s the after market support and accessories. Looking for a new case? So many options for an iPhone. That new Xiaomi model? Sorry, we just had two but they are sold out now.

And that also plays into retail support. Apple stores are everywhere. Much easier to walk into one and get your phone repaired than trying it figure out where there’s a Realme store (and not to mention the whole “Is it hardware? Is it software?” argument).

There is no line like a civilized place so you get helped when you get their attention. Then you get to wait while they assess the situation. After twenty minutes they tell you it’ll take 4 hours to fix the issue so you can wait in the hot, overcrowded store with no comfortable seats or wander through the mall because you had to drive two hours to get to the Apple store so there is no point in going home. Then you come back to pick up your phone and you get to stand around in that awful place for another thirty minutes trying desperately to get the attention of someone who works there.

They've extended the class divide between rich and poor. It's bad enough that the poor suffer in health, shelter, food, and violence. Now they also have their privacy robbed. Maybe you can blame the police for the poor suffering more violence or blame landlords for the poor having no access to shelter. But who is to blame for this new commodity, privacy, belonging only to the elite? You might say that Apple is somewhat to blame.

"I'm actually the opposite of what you described. I think apple hardware is brilliant, but I refuse to purchase any of it because I disagree with the business as a whole. And that's for me personally. I'm not trying to influence other people's decisions. 

Privacy is only one aspect. That doesn't exonerate them for other business practices I strongly disagree with. And it's not like similar controls don't exist on other platforms. What apple does really well is present those options to the user, instead of defaulting to low privacy so most users' settings won't have protections enabled. That's not a problem for me, because I'll dig into any new device and figure that out. If a company makes it easier, I agree with the move 100%, but for my purchase decisions, that's just gravy.

I am a proponent of open standards. Apple has time and time again been at odds with the rest of the industry. Sometimes, like in this case, that is a positive. But in other cases, it closes their products off from working with devices from other manufacturers. That is infuriating, because I buy the best device for a particular situation, I don't care what logo it has, but when one manufacturer refuses to play nice with any other manufacturer, that's a deal breaker.

IMessage, refusing to implement RCS, actively working against progressive web apps a few years ago, making xcode / owning a mac a requirement for compiling iOS apps when other platforms provide emulators and cross platform sdks.

I like to try different technology. If I throw an apple device in, it's the problem step child. I can't use many apple features with the other devices and vice versa. If I buy into apple tech and get stuck in that walled garden, then something new and shiny will come along, and it's harder to jump ship. Then that new would become the problem step child. Because of this, I'd rather just avoid apple devices all together, and it's apples closed philosophy that forces me into that choice.

I will not deny that independent repair shops would 100% benefit from this. But that doesn't mean it's some ulterior or sinister motive.

It's possible for this to be of mutual benefit to both repair shops and independent consumers.

You seem to not realize that each new version of the iPhone is being locked down more and more. As it is right now, if you swap the cameras of two brand new and identical iPhones, the camera will not work properly.

Apple is serializing the hardware IDs of each component so that even though the parts are 100% legitimate the system knows if a part is not the ""original one"". In this instance with the camera, Apple had literally coded artificial ""bugs"" into the camera app to make it seem like the camera is messed up.

which is a valuable feature for customers and completely aligned with apples stated goals and messaging about providing the utmost security and privacy protection. Of course, what repairers really want to do is not swap new parts between identical new phones (why would they). but use old scavenged parts or knock offs, while making a fat profit.

The point is that contrary to what you've said here, it is NOT possible to know they are legitimate if they are swapped out.

No, re-read what I wrote. If you buy two brand new, identical models of iPhone. Then boot them up, verify everything is working as it should, power them off, swap the cameras, and power back on. The cameras will behave as if there is a problem.

Now reverse the process (put the camera modules back into the devices they were shipped with) and the problems magically go away.

A lot of people seem to be labouring under the misapprehension that Facebook makes money by selling your data when it’s the complete opposite: Facebook sells eyeballs, and they use your data to determine which eyeballs to sell. 

So Facebook is already doing absolutely everything it can to “protect” your data, because that monopoly is what allows them to run the (second?) biggest advertising network on the face of the planet.

Most smartphone DACs can process 192/24 sample rates. All can process 16/44.1, which is CD quality, which is already way above 256AAC.  How well they convert the digital sample to audio that is another debate entirely.   With that said, many Bluetooth headphones actually have decent DACs inside that process higher sample rates audio. Again, I'm trying to stay away from having a huge discussion on DACs and amplifiers. 

I'm a vinyl guy myself. Love my Macintosh products.  With that said,  today's HD music streaming services, especially those that support 192/24  sample rates are providing a very high quality audio source.  This source is above CD quality, it's almost studio quality.",1613262220.0,1

Most modern macs last longer then a PC of the same price.

1) Apple works on a release of macOS every year, and there are many small software updates between. When was Windows 10 released again? 

2) There is a severe lack of bloatware on any new Mac. The only thing I didn't really want on my mac when I bought it was Chess. Which is a tiny game that apple made and isn't third party. Lots of the price difference in windows laptops are made up of bloatware. 

3) The build quality of a MacBook Pro is vastly superior to that of a PC of the same price. The majority of laptops still sold today are plastic.

4) the apple integrated system is incredibly well built. I never figured out how to link my laptop to my phone. iMessages syncs up with the INCREDIBLY useful Apple ID in a few clicks. iCloud is vastly superior to OneDrive, and I've used both.

5) To continue on with macOS, it is a much better built OS over windows. Windows suffers from the need to be backwards compatible with hundreds of computers for each new release. For example, the mouse settings on Windows 10 still have very similar, outdated settings from the 90s!

For example, a relatively quick repair job to replace a broken capacitor or resistor becomes a full motherboard swap at the Apple Store, and costs about as much as a whole new laptop.",1613275541.0,-1

"I think that's completely reasonable. As a developer, you own whatever experience the user gets. Some apps are never going to make sense on a laptop, and many if not most others are going to need significant work before they make sense with a keyboard/touchpad. Hell, a lot of pretty basic apps are subpar even with an iPad keyboard. Users, particularly novice users, are going to tend to blame developers when they try to use an app and it sucks on their laptop.

So if Apple didn't let devs exclude their apps from macOS, two things would immediately happen:

1. Developers would start putting big notices in their app store descriptions saying ""THIS IS NOT DESIGNED OR SUPPORTED FOR MACOS""

2. They'd start detecting macOS and popping up warnings in their apps at launch warning users off, or possibly refusing to run.

That's a shitty experience for both devs and end users, and the only upside is slightly quicker availability of the small slice of the iOS ecosystem that actually works nicely on macOS without modification. It's far, far more sensible to let devs do some testing and tweaking before they enable it.",1613282289.0,-1

"I think you underestimate the impact this could have on Facebook. Under certain conditions, far from hurting Apple, this strategy could *kill Instagram*.

In order to motivate enough people to switch to Android, they would need to make Instagram very noticeably worse on iOS, but this would inevitably reduce engagement. If using Instagram becomes annoying, people will waste their time elsewhere, and at the scale of iOS market penetration, I don't think it's out of the question that you'd see a very quick 10-20% overall drop in Instagram traffic. But such a drop, on a social network, is not a localized problem, it is a global problem: if there is a sudden 10% drop in content, then Android users will also notice, and that will reduce *their* engagement. They have no way to offset this effect. Even if iOS users are now motivated to move to Android, they won't do so overnight, and not in droves. But every day they stay on iOS is a punch to Instagram's numbers, and it can only take so many punches before it collapses.

If alternative social networks remain pleasant and snappy on iOS, iOS users will start using them more. Instantly. This will create an influx of content, which will elevate the standing of these competitors, get people talking, and Android users will check them out and start using them more as well (because of the new content from iOS users). If the other social networks play their cards right, through advertising and strategically poaching influencers, this *could* send Instagram into a death spiral.

This is the big issue for Facebook: their biggest strength is in their large network of established users. But this is also their biggest weakness. Apple users are such a large chunk of that network that anything that reduces their engagement as a block has ruinous potential. If they pulled their apps out, for example, it would most likely lead to their total annihilation: half of their content would disappear, leading to reduced engagement from the other half, and before long Facebook is a ghost town, people stop logging in, they get shorted harder than GME, and there's basically no coming back from this. Your proposed strategy is far better, but I still think it's extremely risky. They can't harm Apple significantly: Apple has a fantastic reputation and too many rock solid revenue streams that depends on actual paying customers. Apple, on the other hand, can punch a gaping hole in Facebook's network, and that would quite literally annihilate them.",1613285267.0,1

"i think you're missing the whole point of apples principle. they're a hardware company first, and the most important element to sell hardware is user experience.

you're right, they don't care about privacy. but what they do care about, adamantly so, is user experience. but in most cases, user experience and privacy are one and the same. so it's pretty basic as to why, as they're not stupid, of course they'll market it for the sake of privacy and security when it's in-built into the user experience and differentiates them versus their competition.

apple technology is not always, but usually, localized on your device. and in those cases it means there is no data being collected/used. a good example of this would be apple's face id, which, unlike google and microsoft, relies entirely on a localized chip to work. no connection necessary. no data uploaded or downloaded. it can be used offline. this is a great user experience.

apple also rely on strong security for their products simply because it makes the phone less interesting to steal (again, user experience). if you steal an iphone you will quickly discover that you can't use most of the parts nor can you ever use the actual phone itself, because it is permanently locked to the hardware id of the phone and the user who used it. effectively, you've got a brick that you can't sell to the black market, phone repair shops, or use by yourself.

but, yes. in the cases where user experience is enhanced by an online cloud service system (i.e. icloud backup api, pages, etc). your are leaking data, but that data leak is entirely tied into your user experience. i.e. you can have live collaboration in pages. and icloud backups creates a seamless sync between your apple devices, backups and operation. they also point out that they have the encryption key, which again, is for user experience (they can unlock your data for you if you forget your password). this however does not mean they are harvesting your data and building analytical profiles of you to use in any malicious way like facebook, microsoft and google does. mostly because they aren't harvesting any useful data, your icloud data is mainly third party data and not apple data.

"People in this thread are treating Zuckerberg like he's some sort of fucking joke and that Facebook is some sort of redheaded stepchild that Apple is going to just trounce all over.

Let me take some downvotes and tell you all why you're seriously underestimating the threat, here.

People think Apple is some sort of juggernaut that can do as they please and that just because you agree with what they're doing, they're going to win.

Plenty of people agreed with Standard Oil and their business practices, but they were nevertheless broken up.  Appel operates the hardware, software, AND marketplace that thousands of companies rely upon for their business model, and Apple is trying to tell them what's up.   Facebook is far from the only company being affected by this - they're just the largest.

People think Apple is some behemoth that can buy and sell Facebook on a whim, or at least a majority share.   Apple is the world's largest company, sure... But:

A) More than half of their cash is sitting in overseas banks that they can't bring home without giving up 1/3 of it in taxes.

B) even if they did, what they have is not enough to even force a seat on the Facebook's board.   Apple has $200B in cash, but Facebook is an $800B company.

It's also worth noting that Facebook is currently growing at a much faster rate than Apple.   In a few years they're likely to eclipse them.  Check the numbers for yourself if you don't believe me.

Lastly, you should remember that Apple isn't just trying to eat Facebook's lunch... They're likely to fuck Google over too... And while Apple MIGHT be able to take on Facebook, they won't be able to win a case titled ""*Facebook &amp; Google et al v. Apple*"".

I disagree.  Facebook prints money.   Their revenue grows by 20-30% every year.  They are by no means in decline.  Even with EU restrictions in place.

What Apple is doing is saying that Facebook pretty much has to make people pay money to use their services if they don't opt to share data.   That is throwing up a barrier to Facebook's business model.  And it's honestly a pretty clear violation of federal antitrust law through [restraint of trade.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraint_of_trade).

Well true, but there's nuance there.

Definitely true in the early days of the App Store, where the review cycle could take an arbitrary number of days between 7 and 21 (certainly happened to me).

To a regulator's eye, while Facebook controls social media, they by no means have a monopoly though they might he guilty of antitrust violations due to horizontal integration, that is a more difficult argument to make than the one against Apple.

"You are absolutely correct for being suspicious of a 'news' website that appears to be explicitly marketed towards fans of Elon. As you said, it'd be like getting smartphone news from Apple News.

That said, the physical limits of Starlink are vastly superior to those of other satellite internet providers. Starlink satellites operate in very low earth orbit, so the latency is minimal (20-40ms). Currently, Starlink basically acts like a mirror, bouncing your connection to a downlink to the nearest fiber backbone, with c a round trip of about 1100km at 99.99% of the speed of light. Traditional satellite internet works very similarly, but operates at 35,786km, or about 71,500km round trip, so even at very nearly the speed of light you end up with a latency on the order of many hundreds of milliseconds. Additionally, Starlink will operate tens of thousands of satellites, so there's less total demand for bandwidth per satellite.

"OPEC is a glaring example of price fixing.  They built themselves up based on a SO model of controlling large chunks of the supply and demanding set prices.  The SEC alone has won more price fixing cases than either of us could ever read.

SO drove out competitors by regional dumping and bought everything of value at auction.  Along with huge reserves, they used this to segmentally take over production or coerce everyone into their trusts.  It was not to the public benefit to have one group that could unilaterally control the market, innovation, and employment.  Price history of a market commodity is not the only factor of public benefit, it’s just the most easily explained to show negative impact.

SO absolutely harmed the public interests.  It to a large extent kept individuals from being able to exploit regional resources.  SO had active legal and political campaigns to restrict market access through regulations and changing the way resources could be leased.  They went so far to increasing transportation costs through multiple ways that many supplier went under just because there was no way to transport.  SO was the epitome of a huge corrupting influence on politics, marketplace access, and consumer interests.

"VW was a bit reluctant and late to come to the whole electric vehicle thing and only went all in once the dieselgate thing blew up in their faces.

Now they have their Electric vehicle platform that they plan to use for cars across the whole range of marquees they own from Skoda or Seat to Audi and that they are giving out to small time manufacturers with limited runs who don't have the means to make their own platform and big car makers who want to hedge their bets like Ford.

Things look good on paper for VW.

Their first batch of vehicles on that new platform suffered a lot of Apple like defects where the software running it was far from finished and only did a small number of the things it was promised it would do. One might say it was a beta version. 

With updates they are improving on that and they are also improving the hardware for newer models.

One important thing for e-vehicels in Europe VWs home market is that thanks to government intervention there is a single official standard for charging electric vehicles, which avoids some of the format wars ala VHS vs Beta and HDDVD vs BlueRay that are going on in the US.

This makes things a bit easier for newer entrants in the market and overall helps with acceptance of the new technology thanks to less uncertainty.

One problem with Apple or any other non car maker trying to break into the industry at this point is that cars can't as easily be made in China and shipped to the US or Europe as phones due to tariffs and higher cost of shipping. 

You need factories on the ground to make or at least assemble your products where you want to sell them. This is a much bigger hurdle to entrance than making a smartphone.

Of course apple has all the money in the world if it needs to throw money at a problem to solve it, but money can't buy you time. Building a car factory or assembly plant is not only expsnive but also takes time.

Of course once the electric vehicle thing gets going for real there will be a lot of old car factories in areas with lots of experienced workers available for cheap and someone like apple might come in and roll up the competition from behind.

Analysts have said Nissan, which has an alliance with France’s Renault and Mitsubishi Motors, could be a good fit for Apple.

The Japanese company was a pioneer of electric vehicles with the launch of the Leaf in 2010. Nissan also has capacity in its US plants after the lossmaking group shifted from focusing on volume to profitability.

But Mio Kato, an analyst who writes on the Smartkarma platform, said Nissan lacked the scale of rivals such as Toyota to make the type of large investments required for autonomous driving technology.

Some analysts believed Apple could disrupt the automotive industry, although it is unclear what sort of technology it could provide beyond the power of its brand.

Apple has been testing driverless technologies in California for years. The company disclosed last week that its back-up drivers had to intervene once every 145 miles of testing.

I thought this was fascinating. At many companies you have one team designing the hardware, one team designing the software, and then a marketing team that comes in at the end and markets whatever you get when you put the two together. At Apple under Jobs those three groups were always active participants in the entire process, with Jobs acting as the mediator, and it's how you got products that were so well-integrated across the board.

Now you want to claim their marketshare should be seen as monopolistic.  That’s a difficult case to make because their marketshare is far less than you’re claiming, even the marketshare you’re claiming isn’t an overwhelming average, and there’s no local condition that could be argued amounts to regional exclusion.

Even if somehow Apple saturation somehow became at the level of Facebook monopoly, Apple has a valid, concerted security concern in what goes into their products.  A big part of the Apple niche is the much higher security embedded in their products.

Fighting Apple in this way is a losing proposition.  It runs counter to consumer interests.  Doing so paints FB as an aggressor against options many people want.  It’s extremely unlikely the courts are going to block a simple feature that does what multiple other options also perform, especially if the feature is enabled by an end user only and works to prevent all parties from such information gathering.

"There's more to it than ""giving data"". I'm not giving my data to Apple, more like leveraging Apple's implementation of isolated application storage to limit exposure to everyone else. My biggest concern is app permissions. I'll give you an example. 

Let's take Reddit app for example. It should have 0 access to the data on my device, with the exception of the isolated ""reddit app data"" folder where it caches the data it downloads and user information. 

Now let's say I am signed into the app, and I want to share a picture. I go into the app, tap the ""new post"" button and select the image I want to post. 

On iPhone, I can select exactly which picture I want Reddit app to have access to (this is new in iOS14). Not only that, the app cannot access anything else within my device with the exception of ""reddit app data"" folder and the one picture I selected to share. 

On Android, I cannot select just one picture. I have to grant permissions to ""storage"". This gives the app to permissions to everything on the device. Downloads folder where I might have downloaded my bank statements, or documents from my insurance, or documents from my doctor. It's a blanket permission that allows the app to have access to entire user data partition.

"Apple is a full service vendor that provides partnerships for development on their intellectual property.  Another equivalent would be a chain of car dealerships that only takes consignment of vehicles built on a specific drive chain.  There are lots of dealerships, lots of places to sell vehicles, but this dealership chain has a specific warranty system and quality control guarantee that is appealing to a subset of customers.  Epic signed a contract stating they would provide a commission for all products built on the drive chain to which Apple owns the rights.  Epic then put a poison pill into vehicles that violates the sales agreement by sending all secondary sales items that were part of the deal with Apple to a back alley vendor.

Apple owns the OS, it is their intellectual property.  Apple has a devoted subset of a marketplace largely based on the security and reliability of the products they sell.  Apple runs an exclusive shop for their intellectual property.

Epic was caught red handed violating their contract with Apple.  Their defense has been not only do they not have to abide by the contract, nobody should have to do so to access a niche market.

I’ll go back to the retailer example again.  Walmart doesn’t have to carry Costco brands.  Walmart owns exclusive control of what goes on their shelves.  Walmart could choose to carry such brands but nobody can force them to do so.  Further, nobody can force them to do so for free.  This is the walled garden concept.

Apple is well within their rights to exclude access to their marketplace.  Apple only removed the Epic product because of millions of dollars in commission owed by Epic as stipulated in the contract.  The Epic case didn’t have enough credibility to get a temporary injunction.  That’s an incredibly low bar to meet.

Third party applications could form their own launching system.  It would be difficult and would violate Apple’s OS IP, they in no way license their products for this.  It could be done though, that’s not the case we’re talking through here.

We’re talking about a contract dispute between an application developer who signed a specific contract that attributed commissions.

"I really hate seeing all the stupid hot takes here saying ""but what about Apple using that data instead?"". 

Apple has a real financial motivator to take privacy seriously:

1. Apple mainly makes money from selling devices
2. Apple invests in privacy because it is a selling point for devices
3. If Apple were to turn around and become an advertising business, they would make a little bit of money sacrificing privacy, but they would lose a boatload of money because they can't sell as many devices

Google has a real financial motivator to **not** take privacy seriously:

1. Google mainly makes money from data
2. Google wants to get more data from you, so they can sell more ads
3. If Google were to turn around and start taking privacy seriously, they would get a bit of PR, but they would lose a boatload of money because they get their money from data

Apple is not a charity. I'm sure a lot of people working there are genuinely pro privacy, but Apple is doing this because it happens to align with their business plan. Apple is doing this because it makes them money.

Almost everything Google does is to improve its advertising sales. Almost everything Apple does is to improve its hardware sales. Even though they provide similar services, they are very very different companies.

I constantly see people go ""but android has this privacy protection here"", when it is never ever as powerful as the feature from iOS, and it is almost always default off. Same when people go ""but Apple has this advertising thing here"" it is always some tiny little side project that advertisers hate because it gives them no data.",1613468020.0,-1

With cars, they have the expertise in computers, they're gaining the expertise in an AR heads up display and the drive train is just some batteries and electric motors (much simpler than an ICE vehicle). I think the two biggest stumbling blocks will be the copious safety regulations around cars, which is a lot of work but very doable, and the whole self driving angle which no one has really cracked yet.",1613472688.0,1

A Ford dealership in a town prevents selling of Hondas on their lot.  Costco doesn’t sell Walmart brands.  Amazon doesn’t have to let a banned seller use their platform.  This is the nature of owning a place in a market.

Apple’s OS development is payed for through the application fees.  It’s how their system, which they own all the right to, is developed and then sublicensed for specific device usage.  Anyone can put a different OS on Apple hardware and then access whatever application functions are available to that OS.  There is no hardwiring that prevents different OS implementation.  Apple owns their OS, has security enabled review of all applications in their store, and maintains a commission access system on their store.  The default position always stands until serious laws and cases change the default.

"Your example isn’t applicable to this scenario. These devices aren’t produced by government manufacturers with a security clearance. These are devices that are in people’s hands all over the world. Try as they might, they can’t keep pricing down for long even with using various governments as their own attack dogs. I can still get almost any chip I need or entire screw sets for cheap. Regardless of that, consumers should be given the option of accepting some risk for a reduced price. The sky won’t fall if someone’s screen color is a little off either. But not having any economical or quick options at all can and does disrupt people’s lives. These devices are a lifeline for many people; especially the impoverished. The people that care that much won’t skimp and will go to Apple if it’s an option. 

You’re talking about avoiding doing what’s morally right and beneficial to the great majority of people (yes, non-shareholders are in fact people too) because there will be other artificially created consequences as a result of flaws in our systems and the way we do business.

I work with these devices under the microscope at the board level; regularly doing what’s deemed impossible by Apple or insanely expensive, but it rarely ever costs me more than $35 in disposable materials and parts. I hear what you’re saying, I just don’t agree. I don’t believe in keeping a broken system propped up because not doing so would expose other problems. Problems need to be exposed in order to be addressed at the root level. It’s the same line of thinking to keep using coal because the coal industry would hurt; absolutely asinine and serves to slow progression.

I wish people gave half of a fuck about individual peoples right as much as they do mega corps rights.

And let me tell you, there’s not much magic left under the hood of their products from Apple. I’m sure they will fight tooth and nail to keep documentation and schematics out of the limelight because if they didn’t people would see just how little changes year over year on their products while commanding higher and higher pricing. It’s nearly the same shit repackaged each year to optimize failure while maintaining plausible deniability.

The automotive industry has long gone thruogh this in many jurisdictions and nothing fundamentally changed with regards to vehicle design. 

Just sell parts, make available repair manuals, and make available any special tools  diagnostic tools.

Hasn't nothing to do with taking off of the shelf chips and changing them.   Just that you can't get the custom chips that Apple makes.

&gt; 3 Min Read.BRUSSELS - Fortnite creator Epic Games has taken its fight against Apple to EU antitrust regulators after failing to make headway in a U.S. court in a dispute over the iPhone maker&amp;#039;s payment system on its App Store and control over apps downloads.

&gt; Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said Apple&amp;#039;s control of its platform has tilted the level playing field.

&gt; The company also accused Apple of barring rivals from launching their own gaming subscription service on its platform by preventing them from bundling several games together - when its own service, called Apple Arcade, does that.

"&gt; should companies like Google even be allowed to have this kind of power? 

This is why things are going to be so interesting over the next decade+.     IMO, the Internet broke capitalism.

I became involved with the Internet in 1986.    I started with Bitnet in 1985 and switched over.

Me and most people thought the Internet was going to empower the little guy.    I use to do a lot of presenting on the Internet around the globe in the early days.

We constantly talked about how the Internet leveled the playing field.   But we were completely wrong.   It has ended up being the exact opposite.

Before the Internet in the physical world it was a lot harder to have concentration.    There was a natural barrier.

The connectivity of the Internet is what has enabled the mega corporations like Google, FB, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon.

Right now as I type this the largest companies in the world are dominated by tech companies.   

So they are already mega corporations.  But look at the latest financial results.   Last quarter Google reported they increase profits by more than 40% YoY.  That is NOT a typo.  Google is already just HUGE and yet still able to grow top line by over 20% and bottom line by over 40%!!!!

But what people do not realize is these companies have barely even got started.   Companies like Google and Amazon have tons and tons and tons of runway to work with.

These companies also own assets that are just can NOT be replicated.   Perfect example is YouTube.     

What I believe should be done is a special tax applied to all the big tech companies.    I believe this will ultimately happen but it is a long time off.

The tax should be used to fund a UBI.   The thing that has not yet happened is the job loss.  That will eventually happen.

"&gt;The great age of content-robber barons is drawing to a close. 

If the internet is just interactive cable TV where you get to pick the channels, big tech in the form of Apple and Google will still be the gatekeeper of app stores, platforms, the infrastructure.

If you get your wish and search engines and social media and the web itself dies off, then you still won't get to see news journalism come back. It won't come back because the media market shifted from regional in the age of print/broadcasting to quasi-global due to the internet. We don't need 1000s of different regional TV stations from each of 4 networks plus a couple of regional newspapers each re-selling the same garbage McNews from the Associated Press.

Guess what, 99% of people will subscribe to maybe 2-3 services. They'll all subscribe to the same ones, all over America and in Canada, Australia, the UK, NZ, etc too. Google will probably be one of the players. And in this new market where search engines don't exist anymore, it will be really hard if not impossible for the general public to find alternative sources. Also if social media goes away, you can't talk to other people about other topics and interests and use that to find sources. We'll be in the dark.

Oh sure, maybe print could come back for everything excluded from the internet. Maybe people could socialize in person. Except now we live in a world where people watch Netflix and play video games in the air conditioning of their suburban home in a dead lifeless corner of sprawlsville. American society is naturally isolating and the internet cannot be blamed. It's too late. It can't compete. Make the internet less social and take away means to find a broader scope of information and now you just have 350 million people attached to the one-way feeding tube of content like foie gras geese.

At least now the internet is bi-directional, participatory, and empowering, this is the only thing saving the future from being terrifying, but if people like you get their wish it won't be and we are doomed.

In my view Apple has only made minimal effort to diversify production outside of China, the stuff done in the States was mere window dressing for Trump. And that production which has started up outside of China is minimal in terms of overall production, it is not replacing or really even capping the Apple existing and expanding production in China. Hence I don't consider Apple, or a lot of similar companies, 'have' to deal with China, they do so because it is a manufacturing dynamo, and in some areas, such as tech, is currently unmatched in terms of expertise, efficiency and cost effectiveness. 

That said, some of massive domestic projects China has used to fuel its heated economic growth are more white elephant than anything else, and I do wonder how long that can be kept going, particularly if there were a collaborative and concerted effort by many nations to reel China in a bit.",1613889636.0,1

"So, Apple is kind of famous for doing this--which demonstrates it's unusual.

For 2021, it has $193B in cash on hand, and $111B turnover for Q1. The cash on hand is a strategic reserve it has built up and now constitutes about 50% of its overall turnover.

It's 2016 to 2020 net margin % was 21.6%. 

The following math is demonstrative only (since Apple's turnover was lower in 2016 ($211B) as was it's cash on hand ($67B)).  


If Apple built it's $67B to $193B, i.e., $130B, evenly over the last 4 years based on its net profit (this is almost certainly conservative as balance sheet cash on hand can come from deferred/unripe liabilities), that would have only taken deferral of 1/4 of its incoming net profit cashflow.

"Thank you. Glad someone with your credentials responded to my query. First off, want to say I believe patents serve a purpose and are necessary, but more and more I feel it's companies, not inventors owning these patents and companies have a lot of power/money to lobby congress to make sure these patents generate the most profits forever. 
Q2: ""OK but how can companies afford to pay these salaries before they have even made their product?""
Microsoft, Google, Apple, FB, etc. Are richer than most countries. The problem seems to be the law must be designed to protect the little guy who makes something, but all the patentable products are owned by a corporation, made by an employee.
Maybe I'm just a bitter old man. I bought a Windows 10 laptop a few months ago. Office 360 should be illegal. Pay for software forever and ever. No. The guy who wrote the original word probably did so in the 80's. Is he getting a piece of this? No. 
Again, I want to thank you. I've gotten some great responses. IMO, the greatest outcome for consumers seems to be a compromise between theory and practice.

Economies of scale is a real thing in stuff like this. Even if something like a micro SD reader costs pennies, if you're planning on making millions or even billions of something, that adds up, and is something you really have to consider before adding on. 

On the topic on if people want SD cards, it's about the same as the 3.5mm jack. Was it shitty when Apple and others used crappy excuses for removing it? Of course, just say it like it is; we want to focus that space and those pennies on other components. 

I haven't used an SD card outside of 3D printing for... God, years. Most people I know would say the same. The format has it's uses, but when it comes to a smart watch, it simply... Doesn't.

The biggest problem with the absence of IP would probably be the exacerbation of ""theft"" (well without IP there's not really anything to ""steal"") of ideas e.g Apple copying an app and integrating its functionality into their own products.

* total yearly sales of apps and in-app products
* annual advertising revenue from Steam
* annual sales of external products attributed to Steam
* annual revenue from Steam
* annual earning from Steam whether gross or net

Apple feels this request is necessary to show the total size of the market that Epics operates in. based on a case that says ""stating that one issue Apple must prove is “the strength of competition for consumers and app developers” among digital distribution platforms ""

Samsung was also told to produce the same information. 

REQUEST 32

* Name of each app on Steam
* the date range when each app was available on Steam
* the price of the app and any in-app products available on Steam

This information is said to be necessary to determine the scope and breath of the digital marketplace.

VALVE'S RESPONSE

* We don't sell mobile game (i.e. sell games on phones or tablets)
* Steam users cannot buy or sell mobile apps on Steam
* 99% of steam games are sold other places and 3rd party developers control the price of their games
* Steam doesn't offer Fortnite and will not be on Steam based on EPIC's statements
* Apples request is not narrow and would cost to much to provide

Apple requested information on 436 games from 2015 to present. They wanted to know about every version, all digital content or items for each of these games. As well as

*  The dates on sale, plus every price and price change,from 2015 to the present

"I think you're jumping to conclusions a bit. It'd cost more in manufacturing to go with a different charger than what they had tooling for before, just to sell more appliances. It's **far** more likely that it has a different type of battery in terms of its size in comparison to the previous generation. 

Also, it doesn't really ring out true across technologies. Most of the stuff we still have around from 70+ years ago was ""built to last"" but it also was typically the most expensive product of it's type in it's day.

The most common item people point to as an example of planned obsolescence is often iPhones. But what most people don't understand is that Lithium Ion batteries themselves only have a lifespan of a couple years. Apple slows down older phones as a way to extend the battery life. Depending on how often you have your phone hooked up to its charger, as much as 1/3rd of the max capacity on the battery could have diminished. 

But you can't make a phone that's water-proof, shock-proof, and has interchangeable parts. It's just not possible. If you want a product that's built to last, I'm by no means saying iPhones are ""it"" but the very thing that's being done people often point to as an indicator for planned obsolescence, is literally the only thing that can be done farther to extend that product's life.

I work as a graphic artist, and a big part of what I need to do is to look at older works that were made for completely different display standards and technology, and I often need to create things that will be relevant in for emerging standards as well as try my best to recreate and intended look of older standards.

"But that has literally not been Valves operating procedure like ever.
They have predominantly been of the ""if we just give people what they want, or give them a tool to do what they want themselves, we don't need to bother with anything else.""
If they like what you are doing, they will throw money at you and ask you to do it for them.

Like they didn't even mount a huge counter-push at Epics fallacious whining about the 30%. At the time Epic was buying up exclusives proclaiming a better cut, when in reality Valve for almost forever has been going ""you can sell you games wherever you want, and we don't get a cut, but will still provide the infrastructure, as long as you ALSO put it up on our shop for the same price, and of THOSE we would like 30%"". And considering the boom of bundles and charity giveaways and and... I'd wonder if that 30% even comes close to a 10% cut per serviced copy altogether.

This is at the core of the fight between Epic and Apple. Epic TRIED to do what apple does basically, but had to retreat and provide 3rd party sellers access to a lot (but not all) of their exclusives to mimick Valve (because way to few people other than those that already HAD the launcher due to fortnight gave a shit about their approach to forcing themselves into the market whining about ""necessity"" when it never really WAS), and basically are crying about Apple still being allowed the ""walled garden"" approach.

"It's a bit more complex than you describe with Google. They had three things - Search, News, and the new thing, Showcase.
 
Search is the thing we all know and love - punch in some text and it will rifle through its massive text indexes to find relevant content and then personalise the results ordering to what Google thinks you expect (that's why Google always seems to ""search better"" - confirmation bias by design). Of each page, Google displays a hyperlink, title, and a text summary of two lines or so which provides the context in which your search result was found. News websites are demanding money for this, despite it clearly falling into the fair use provisions of copyright law.
 
News is a little more controlled - Google algorithms determine if a site in the index is a news site, or something else. News sites are then surfaced into the news index almost the same as search - except that unlike search it also displays a discovery screen that lists news based on current events and your location (presumably they rely on their [trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore)). Like search, it also displays a headline, but it does not display *any* text from the linked page, unless you came in via a search and selected ""News"" - in which case it displays the same two line excerpt, but doesn't select the two lines for context. Clicking on that headline, despite disinformation spread by the media and media commentators, sends you directly to the article on the news publisher's website. This is also unequivocally fair use, and the news publishers are demanding to be paid for it.
 
Showcase is different. Showcase, which we haven't yet seen, is where Google pays a publisher to curate selected news articles from their collection and make them available to Google users via the Showcase (which I assume will be like Apple News). Google likely will host the articles for these, as they are paying for a license and will want to maintain a consistent experience among all Showcase articles and publishers. This use *isn't* fair use, but Google is making commercial agreements to use the content in this way - which is how it's meant to work, and was nothing to do with Scotty's admonishment on the news, because Google has been working on it longer than Frydenberg has been shitting out this draft regulation.
 
In all cases, either fair use or a commercial agreement applies. In all cases, the news publisher has an opt out - for News and Search, two lines in robots.txt and you disappear entirely, hey look no more ""stealing"" (fair use). For News, publishers can even ""claim"" their mastheads in it and have more control over what, if any, is displayed in results, and even share in ad revenue from news pages. For Showcase, they just, er, don't make an agreement.
 
On AMP, you're wrong, but it's a common misconception. Google will *only* serve pages from the AMP cache when the target website provided an AMP page to Google in the first place. Additionally, nothing prevents those AMP pages having ads on them (the OpenJS Foundation, who develop and administer the AMP protocol, assert that because AMP ads are faster, they increase impressions and click through rates). This is the same as Bing, who also have an AMP Cache. Neither Google nor Bing ever scrape an ordinary HTML page and create an AMP page from it.",1613947636.0,1

I think it's reasonable to say that given the scrutiny on Apple, we would know if Apple has been unnecessarily throttling old devices. If they had been, then surely the lawsuits would have focused on that rather than just on Apple not informing users of the updates that began the throttling. The default is still for iPhones to be throttled if required to prevent shutdowns, and it doesn't appear that anyone is challenging that.

Apple's decision to not communicate the throttling to users was wrong, and the lawsuits were entirely justified. Their current position (where throttling still occurs, but users are made aware that it is due to an aging battery and can switch off the throttling if required) is fine in my opinion. The alternative would be for people to have unexplained shutdowns of their device when the battery can't maintain the required voltage.",1613948651.0,1

At any rate, I'm sorry for being so pedantic.   I don't think that Apple deserves either my devotion or my ire (at least any more than other huge corps).  Obviously I have my opinions, but I've gone to great pains to try and discuss these things in the most fact based approach I can.

They give you a number just like a prisoner that is used to link your browsing habits, window sizes, searches, and every keystroke or click in an app or browser. This is why everyone and their brother wants you to install a smart phone app because it gives them much more data about you to sell to 3rd party aggregators. 

You are not getting any of those services for free. Why do you think Facebook is so upset that Apple is allowing you the option to opt out of sharing data from every app? They know you will opt out unless they make it painful to not opt in. That means more people will stop using Facebook. It also means they have to keep increasing monetization of the remaining users to hide how many people they have already lost direct contact with.

"Most lower court decisions in a trial are not immediately appealable. You have to wait until the end of the case and appeal everything. 

This is different. A non-party subpoena is appealable immediately in this context. It is called an interlocutory appeal. Valve can appeal to the court of appeals, and if that goes against them, to the Colorado Supreme Court. If the information sought is key to Apple, they can push it and delay things at the lower court until the non-party subpoena is resolved. Depending on whether it is expedited, it is possible to take a couple of years to go through the whole process, but it can't be dragged out indefinitely.

Valve could also seek a stay of the lower court ruling requiring production while they appeal. They are almost definitely not going to produce the requested internal information without a big fight. Also, Apple may have very good grounds for getting the information and if it is essential to their case, that will be balanced against the damage to Valve. 

If the concern is that the info qill be improperly used by Apple for competitive purposes, Valve can designate it Attorneys Eyes Only so not Apple personnel can actually look at it. There are ways of balancing all these concerns.",1613951542.0,1
"Apple has no interest in the PC gaming market.  Their products are competitively priced compared to other high-end business laptops. They would not be interested in cutting the corners required to compete with gaming rigs. 

They compete in mobile games, but their computers are for the business/design/productivity  market. They've even come out with a new proprietary chipset that games can't run on unless through an emulator, a chipset that game companies are not going to bother making games for. They don't even make serious games for Intel macs, which would require far fewer changes. 


Apple is looking to get a broad sense of how all of the distribution platforms work and what they charge. If Valve is also taking a big cut from in-game purchases, Apple can use that as evidence that it is following a standard industry practice. That is essential for defense against an antitrust claim of this type.

That is to say, if other platforms have charges in the same neighborhood for similar products/features, Apple is just following standard industry practice. If Apple's captive customer base is forced to pay a lot more because they happen to use iPhones, that's no bueno for Apple.

Apple can't present a comprehensive defense unless it has this information across gaming distribution platforms. Valve's excuse that desktop is different than mobile is empty, because it will ultimately be up to the jury or judge to determine the relevance of those differences while it reviews the evidence as a whole.

There's a reason Samsung didn't fight this, even though Apple is its greatest frenemy - these requests are allowed to be very broad.

"When i say not want to get into the nut and bolts, i do not mean can not.

Macs are nice systems for people who want a dev environment, or really a machine for any purpose, that is low maintenance in terms of admin type maintenance. The nuts and bolts. As anyone whose used ubuntu or similar GUI type OS will tell you, their is a big learning curve initially and they tend to you have to be a bit more hands on with the maintenance than you do with a mac. So someone who doesn't want to deal with the nuts and bolts of that will run a mac.

Running a mac and getting that ""it just works"" computer, something web-developers seem to love, comes at a cost. The biggest cost for me being the money with the second being the annoying idiosyncrasies i find that are largely in place because it is a device sold to people who want something that just works. There is also an annoyance i find with the devices not being easily modded into something usable when apple stop supporting them but that is a whole other problem. So, but, whatever, they're pretty, they run silky, and the web-developers i work with use them. So when i work with those guys it is easier if i have the same machine and setup that they do.

Does that answer your question? If not, here's a little more.

At my work i connect a mainframe set of processes and several on-site infrastructure systems to a browser based GUI front end that is mostly served up from a bunch of Off-site infrastructure. My PC can do everything i need to support and dev this whole mess if i must but doing so is a giant PITA for a variety of reasons beyond the scope of this explanation.

"Apple is basically just trying to insinuate that they and Steam are in the same business model when they really aren't.

They both do get a cut of the sales from games on their stores and they sell games/programs. That's about the only commonality here.

iPhones have alternate app stores that are not the Apple official one, just as PCs have alternate game stores (EPIC, Good Old Games, etc). Apple however has a condition in their ToS for devs putting apps onto their store that they may not post their app to non-Apple app stores accessible from iPhones. Meaning that if a dev wants to post their game on both stores, Apple will remove them from the iPhone app store. Steam doesn't care if you are on their platform, EPIC, GoG, your own independent website, etc. If a game is a ""Steam Exclusive"" then that is either the choice of the developer, or under the purview of an economic deal between Steam and that developer where Steam is paying the Dev to do so, instead of forcing them like Apple.

The Apple app store is a default app on the iPhone and installing the other app stores has just enough of a technical bar for entry that the majority of their users do not go through the effort of doing so. Meanwhile Steam is not the default app on anything beyond the unfortunately failed Steam Machine, in which case the Steam store IS the machine rather than being part of it. So people have to WANT to be a Steam user, whereas general laziness, apathy, and even lack of technical knowledge can prevent someone from LEAVING the Apple app store.",1613955160.0,-1

"Isn't Valve's business model for PC (and Mac) games relatively similar to app stores on phones? Both Apple and Epic's legal teams asked for this information.

But the answer is in the letter:

&gt; Apple’s Request 2 is very narrow. It simply requests documents sufficient to show Valve’s: (a) total yearly sales of apps and in-app products; (b) annual advertising revenues from Steam; (c) annual sales of external products attributable to Steam; (d) annual revenues from Steam; and (e) annual earnings (whether gross or net) from Steam. Apple has gone as far as requesting this information in any readily accessible format, but Valve refuses to produce it.     
&gt; Request 2 is crucial for calculating the total size of the market for Epic’s available digital distribution channels, which this Court already has found highly relevant to this case.

&gt; Request 32 asks for documents sufficient to show: (a) the name of each App on Steam; (b) the date range when the App was available on Steam; and (c) the price of the App and any in-app product available on Steam. This is basic information relating to the identity and availability of games over time on Steam, is necessary to determine the scope and breadth of the digital distribution marketplace, and is “relevant to showing competition” between these platforms.

"You severely underestimate the cost of developing and maintaining rock solid and very mature systems. Yes, their cut is a tad too big, but their infrastructure supports a lot, even from users who play free games or the purchased the game from elsewhere. Also, they are private, not public traded; they do not answer to share holders and do not have an influx of random investment money.

Playing the copycat game is much easier as you essentially need to replicate and buy infrastructure.

Also, no infrastructure or developer time is free, and therefore you'd never get 25% less. 25% is a very fair tax at the small scale Valve started, but the current cost, even in this massive scale is not nearly 0. They operate their CDN in a lot of data centers, 24/7 staff monitoring every single of them. Massive hardware and bandwidth costs. There's probably quite a few people helping game developers integrate with the platform. Player support. R&amp;D towards steam and most pieces of tech it supports. For instance, Valve sponsors the open development and optimization of drivers and projects such as Wine.

EPIC meanwhile maintains a copycat platform. Sure, they develop Unreal, but that doesn't really add any direct value to EGS. 
And Apple, Apple does a lot, but their focus is not value, is 100% whatever locks users and brings profits.

"This is part of the discovery process. It is a part of nearly every legal case in existence. Apple has to prove that they aren’t a monopoly. You do that by showing all other similar competitors, their sales, profits and market details, so the judge can compare. 

This is what’s happening. Epic is asking for the same thing. Apple isn’t “suing” Valve. A subpoena is just a thing that says, “someone has asked, **and the court has agreed**, that some information is legally required from you. You must provide it / show up / respond somehow within the rules, or you are breaking the law.”

Whether Apple is “trying to get market information” or not, this is 100% normal.

I’ll try to give you a legal analogy:

* You are sued by someone because they fell down in front of your house and broke a bone. They say you are legally liable for their injury because you didn’t fix your sidewalk and knew it was broken.

* You need to defend yourself. You’re pretty sure this person has no case because they’ve never even been to your neighborhood, but you don’t have any proof.

* as part of the process of **discovery** (where you can request information from the people suing you to help prove your case and they can do the same), your attorney files with the court to subpoena *your neighbor across the street* because she has security cameras recording the street 24 hours a day. Does she have *anything* to do with the lawsuit? No, but the court has decided that she has information that could reveal the truth, and legally requiring her to give up the footage is appropriate.

It’s not the greatest example, but it explains the process. That’s what this is. Apple (and Epic) have filed their “wish list” for what they would like to know *from anyone*. The judge will decide whether it is legally appropriate. Valve has a right to respond through their own legal team, just like the lady with the cameras can respond by filling out the appropriate form and ticking the right boxes. Then, the judge decides whether her response is valid (maybe her cameras don’t capture the sidewalk across the street, so they wouldn’t be useful.)

"Things Valve have absolutely done and can be verified?  

* Worked with third parties to enable and profit from underage gambling on loot boxes and skins.  

* Loot boxes in CS:GO being so successful is the biggest reason for their explosion in gaming a few years back.  

* Steam has always been a shitty DRM platform.  It is now its own version of too big to fail, an endemic of the modern gaming landscape that can hold consumers' paid-for goods for ransom if it ever wanted to - and in various cases, it has.  

* 30% store fee from the ticket price (for the first $10m) is obscenely big, but they get away with it because devs and publishers have such limited alternative options.  

* Allowing shovelware on their monopoly platform made it even harder for customers to find superior content.  

* The Early Access model they pioneered is a mixed bag, mostly weighted to the negative side.  Not only are there probably more games which have failed to live up to their original promises than those which have, it's also made broken, buggy and unfinished games more palatable to consumers when it can be argued they should never be acceptable.  

* Anti consumer practices it took them an unreasonable amount of time to address, e.g. no returns for many years.  

* Spiteful store management; after being hit with a slap on the wrist fine because they didn't comply with Australian consumer law, they doubled down.  Pulled all signs it was an Aussie store while still forcing Aussies to a separate, Australians-only storefront, and put Australian game prices but in unmarked USD (so many would unwittingly be paying $99.99 USD for a basic game) - saying they were not an Aussie store so they're not subject to any relevant laws.  This only changed shortly before a new law that made it possible to punish companies which deceived Aussie customers came into effect.

* Valve have the most obnoxious, Apple-like cult worshipper fans in gaming.  Even worse than console fanbois.  These dimwitted Valve worshippers have dominated the gaming landscape for nearly two decades, fostering a gaming landscape that's a shell of what it was before the finances these masses brought with them snuffed out virtually all creativity and room for different perspectives in videogames - especially in Western markets.  And these people will tell you Valve saved gaming.  Valve are the single most responsible party for its *condemnation*.  

Valve is the biggest industry leader in videogames.  They consistently showed, particularly between 1998 and 2015, the way forward whether its in game design or monetisation - and that direction has consistently proven to be toxic.

The walled garden is exactly why many like that product. I prefer full access to my devices, but my wants should not infringe on others. If they prefer a curated experience, let them have it, not everyone is tech savvy and prefer that thise in the know keep them safe.

Obviously, keeping them safe isn't the only reason that apple does this, but it is why many like it

Wrong. It is because of their overall market manipulations (having colateral exclusivity is different from enforcing exclusivity), because they withdrew a port from a game that was already launched (Rocket League), because they are in bed with China, and a lot more crap that I don't really remember right now.

&gt; Because if they let you do that, then everyone would just buy your game from Steam

Everyone would do that because Steam is well known and provides an overall great service. Yet if games were cheaper somewhere else some people would prefer that somewhere else. Valve isn't imposing restrictions on selling on other stores, at all.

&gt; Steam is the reason we can't have the perfect F-Droid system of distribution 

If no Valve-alike company pulled a Steam, ever, you wouldn't have downloadable games in the first place. Valve pioneered that and simply stayed that way. Other businesses are free to offer better propositions.

We can't have an F-Droid alike system for the same reason we don't have a Matrix-alike messaging protocol in the mainstream, because it requires a critical mass to dance the tango and companies don't enjoy losing control over their userbase. It would probably require legal decrees enforcing some sort of standardisation.
Same logic why there are 10 different yet the same ways to call taxis from your phone; they all should be standardised into protocols that every application can use, but businesses wouldn't volunteer to do that as it would imply suicide if done alone.

&gt; This was the first time a game had to be installed through a launcher

I hate DRM and don't think that there is DRM ever; yet, having not every bad thing is the same as every other. For instance Riot games is much shittier in its DRM practices than Steam. Valve has bad things, just not the same magnitude of them as CCP CHUNGUS Games nor Sweatshop Co. CDPR is also generally regarded for their good practices toward DRM, yet they whip workers and release half baked games. Nothing is perfect.

&gt; Now, if you make a game and don't want to pay that 30%, because other software frankly does all of those things better for cheaper, you can't.

Thing is, you can simply ask game developers to sell their games somewhere else, and a lot do. Most games on steam can also be found somewhere else such as GOG and Itch.  Big ass corps have their IP departments demanding DRM and whatever, for the same reason movie corps demand DRM despite the immense pressure piracy poses for them to change their business models. It allows execs to throw blames at someone but themselves.

&gt;  You won't sell your game anywhere else.

You're a outlier... Malicious software, like scams, aren't targeted at people who understand them. If you are aware of the malicious software on your machine, it wasn't  you weren't it's targeted demographic.  


Malicious software designed for MacOS is probably not less common than malicious software designed for Windows or Linux.  


Malicious software for Mac and Linux are simply *estimated* to be engineered less frequently, as those machines make up a smaller portion of the standard consumer's home computer market. There's simply more people to exploit and thus more money in engineering malicious software for Windows.  


The dirty truth is: both Windows and MacOS are closed source, No one but Microsoft and Apple modify or review their own code. So they only implement bug/exploit fixes as a reactionary process after exploits are revealed and processed through their organization's red tape. This can sometimes take days, weeks, or decades from the time an exploit is used.  


However, I'd argue that malicious software for Apple computers is more lucrative, thus more common, than any other system, because a larger portion of apple users are incompetent when it comes to computer security and all of them have enough disposable income to purchase a computer that comes with branding fees.  


It's truly impossible to say which operating system receives malicious software the least, as the only things preventing malicious software are responsible browsing habits and the number of people finding exploitable code and fixing it.",1614013658.0,-1

"How more time do you think it needs? They have been pretty consistent in what they think of monetisation of their ideas up so far, and it's not like they are ""a fresh startup"" we know little about?
And I think the ""moral"" logic you are applying is simplistic.
Private companies (as opposed to publicly traded ones) regularly have moral boundaries. The same way that their owners can be excruciatingly stubborn about certain structures ""because that's the way they like it"".

They may not be the moral boundaries you agree with, but most of them do not base their full operation parameters purely on profit maximisation including a view on ""legality"" as purely a cost/benefit or riks/benefit hurdle.

That is not to say that Valve is somehow messianic in nature and/or operating as a non-profit. Over the years there have regularly been individual decisions that have been questioned as ""pushing it"" in the greed department. Despite that they have left most ""really maximisation"" on the table that competitors readily took and ran with it, and most of the time that was pretty cohesive with a (by now) pretty detailed picture of where they draw the line between ""we are operating a business, still"" and ""enough is enough, our customers are not chattle"".

That is the benefit of not being publicly traded. You are only beholden to a very limited set of investors, there are limited legal frameworks who and why your moral framework can be interfered with in the name of shareholder maximisation, and there no actual way to FORCE a hostile takeover as sabotaging your stock price and buying out shares against you.

And they worked hard to be in that position with little ""non in family"" shareholding or someone being able to force their hand.

They didn't barge into the marked way back like Epic is justifying as ""necessary"" to back then try to aggressively cut out brick and mortar with third party exclusives. They never created a walled garden approach to being a storefront.

"Macs are computers, so they can be infected with malware just as any other computer. It’s just not very likely in their default configuration.

By default, a Mac will only run signed software, and to run unsigned software you need to actively confirm that you want to run it, and not just by double clicking it. You need to right click and select open, otherwise it will just refuse to run it.

By only allowing signed software to run they gain two things. Unsigned malware will just be refused to run. Signed malware however will be allowed to run, but with a snap of their fingers, Apple can revoke the certificate for the malware, and it’s now once again a useless piece of software that cannot be started. 

Contrary to popular belief, MacOS actually has anti malware built in. [XProtect and MRT](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/security/sec469d47bd8/web) does a fine job. XProtect keeps it away (once it’s known), and Malware Removal Tool can remove it if the os is already infected.

"Silver Sparrow is a relatively harmless trojan (not a virus as so many clueless people keep calling it).

-	A **computer virus** is malware that automatically replicates itself to spread to other files/computers.
-	A **trojan** is malware that is made to look like it’s a legitimate app (but actually contains malware) in order to trick people into downloading and installing it.

The malware has been found on Macs in 153 countries with detections concentrated in the US, UK, Canada, France, and Germany.

This is a simple trojan, which means the 30,000 Mac users who were infected were gullible enough to:

-	download this malware,
-	run the installer, and
-	enter their administrator username and password when prompted.

If they hadn’t done all of these steps, they would not be infected.

The current version of the malware doesn’t actually have a payload. In other words, once installed, it doesn’t actually do anything. In fact researchers found that when executed, the x86_64 binary displays the words “Hello World!” while the M1 binary reads “You did it!”.

This malware does not *only* target M1 Macs - it simply comes with a binary in mach-object format compiled for Intel x86_64 processors and another Mach-O binary for the M1. The obvious reason for this is the author wanted the malware to be able to run on Macs with Apple Silicon as well as Macs with Intel silicon.

How do you avoid (or get rid of) this malware?

Removing it is very easy. Just run **Malwarebytes**, and you’re done. Apple has already revoked the offending developer certificate(s), which prevents payload binaries from running on updated Macs.

Avoiding it is also very easy. All you need to do is follow some simple safe computing practices:

-	**always install macOS security updates in a timely manner** after they are released
-	**always run an ad blocker** like 1Blocker X or AdBlock Plus in your web browser so that you won't see distracting advertising as well as unsolicited pop-up windows that claim you are somehow ""infected"" or ""missing some video software"" and therefore need to download and install some piece of untrusted software on your computer to fix some supposed ""problem"" they supposedly ""detected"" - and if you do still see these, don't fall for them as they are obvious scams

The **only** reason that the Steam store has a return policy **at all** is because the Australian government forced them too. Before that they didn't.

They refused, for years, to sell in local currency while simultaneously selling at a different price than the main US store.

The only reason I installed the steam client in the first place was because a game I bought physically required it.

That's not even counting how they pressure creators to deeply discount their games or used a virtual monopoly to take a slice of pretty well every PC game sale for years. 

Exclusives, lockins, anti consumer tactics, bullying of creators, Valve have done it all. Because they're not a bunch of philanthropists building a better tomorrow, they're a massive private for profit company.

It really isn't. Uplay is worse and GOG is about the same. I've got both installed. Hell it's better than steam was when I installed it.

&gt; The GOG client is light years better than the EPIC client. Everything you wrote is verifiably false.

It's not, not even close, but that's not the point. They're pretty close to each other. 

The point is that it's worse than the Steam client because this is what we're talking about, competition for steam.

Epic has exclusives, they don't need a better client.

GOG needs something besides no DRM.

But those stores will never be competition because Uplay and EA have no interest in making them competition.

Literally everything on them can be bought on steam even if it ends up in their store anyway.

I don't give a fuck about Tim Sweeney. I care about where I can buy games I want conveniently and for a good price.

Your NBC argument is a compelling and I see why you latched on it it, but it is a poor analogy because the overlap in concept is similar, but the actual reality is totally different.

This isn't quite a proper comparison. Though you CAN use those consoles for other purposes than gaming, the average user is purchasing them for their gaming abilities and content lists. Meanwhile the iPhone is a phone first, app platform second, and smartphones aren't REALLY considered gaming platforms by the wider public at large.

Furthermore, the comparison fails further still because while Microsoft has a monopoly on what content makes it to the XBox and Sony to the PS, what they are controlling is entry to their particular console and nothing further. There are exclusivity contracts, and of course development studios owned by both are likely to push console exclusive games, but these are either situations where the studio is being PAID to be exclusive or is exclusive by their own uncoerced choice. Meanwhile Apple does not give its app developers economic incentives to be exclusive, only economic disincentives (punishment) for violating exclusivity.

To put it another way, Microsoft and Sony do not punish a developer for supporting the capability of customers to load their games on a jailbreaked version of the console though they reserve the right to punish the customer for doing so, meanwhile Apple is targeting the developers.",1614198455.0,-1

"Buy cell phones from a couple of (at the time) washups.  When I think about how much that goddamn advertising blitz must have cost, I get angry.  RadioShack becoming a cell phone store not only felt trashy, it took repair and the whole simple electronics hobby out of the mainstream, and out of people's consciousness.

They are to be blamed for far more than just some investment losses; they also got to essentially make the decision that the end consumer didn't need to know how anything worked inside - Despite the poor, observed life span of everything they sold up front, and in mailers.  It didn't work for The Sharper Image. Why the hell did they think a lower-budget version of TSI's model was ever going to work?

The answer is, they didn't.  But the group that owned that company was going to extract every last cent of value from RadioShack, while also testing out introducing an old business model that seemed to be growing new wings.

Subscriptions.  They just made sure they were playing with someone else's subscription service.  The late 90's and early 00's, there was an enormous oversaturation of mobile devices and vendors coming to market.  The screws on this industry weren't really tightened up until after the introduction of the iPhone in 2007.  Suddenly, all cellular carriers seemed to adopt the Apple Store model.  

All the kitch that served to separate the individual aesthetic of each brand was gutted, stripped down to the bones, and replaced with a clinical look and feel, designed to be as neutral, and widely appealing as possible.  When you're trying to please everyone, you can't stand for anything.

That's how we've arrived at today.  Every remaining brick and mortar business is just a carbon copy of every other.  With each too afraid to step out of line to actually innovate.  Early bird gets the worm; but slow and steady wins the race.

Chances are, if you gain any notoriety as a company for actually doing something different, you are viewed as a direct threat, and bought out with an offer that most do not refuse.  The corporate establishment is going to obfuscate or kill your, ""fresh ideas"" one way or another.  To them, that's how to best provide value to their investors.  Investors who will always come before the value-added product offered to the end customer.

But, without research, maybe the other services pay better.  I know Napster does.  So if Napster grew, that would help musicians.)

Spotify is not a free market.  Spotify is the one determining how much a song gets.  Further, two songs within Spotify can both get 1,000 plays, but will get paid differently.  The small musician will make less.

So it is not the people that are listening that are deciding how much a song is worth.

&gt; I think you should be paid the same per stream.

This is part of my point.  On Spotify, probably others, big musicians that are already making millions, will make more per play than a small musician.  

&gt; THAT was the original question; Spotify thinks raising prices leads to more piracy.

If you read the article, Spotify didn't just suddenly say, Hey, raising prices will cause more piracy.  The MPs are writing a report on music streaming.  ""It was set up last year to investigate whether musicians are being paid fairly by services like Spotify, Amazon Music and Apple Music.""

So this MP report might say Spotify is underpaying artist.  So just before the report is done or sent, they say We don't want to raise prices as that could lead to more piracy.

"&gt; Apple is literally doing the same thing as Microsoft with webkit.

Yeah and it probably would be anti-trust if Apple controlled more than 25% of the mobile market in many places.

Moreover just because they do anti-trust actions doesn't mean *this one* is.

&gt; Apple's play store is not like steam and ios is not like PC. Google can make that argument, but epic literally can't release their game on ios unless they use Apple's store.

I think you meant Apple instead of Google there?

I think the argument Apple wants to make is that iOS isn't a gaming platform monopoly. There's consoles, there's PCs, there's android, and they each control a much larger segment of the market. At least in theory.

Now if iOS isn't a monopoly gaming platform, this means that EPIC has choices to not release its game on iOS but still release its game.

*If* (**hypothetically**) we take the above to be true, then this gives a bit more credence to Apple's argument that its actions make it a more attractive platform. After all EPIC, and all the other game companies ""getting screwed by Apple"" could move their games away overnight and make Apple lose all value it has as a gaming platforms. But they stick, because it's not as terrible as EPIC puts it, that is they chose to go into the platform, because they saw it as a good opportunity. They weren't forced, they actually took the effort to get their game running on iOS.

&gt; In fact, apple disallowed stadia on ios saying that every single game most be individually added to the app store and subject to apple handling all payments and using the review system.

Apple is free to consider how their phone should work and what is fine and what isn't. Moreover if Stadia is truly the amazing app that makes people's lives better they'd choose an Android phone. Anti-trust requires that the company's control harm the markets ability to self-regulate. If a company doesn't control the majority of the market, then you can't say its actions are forced.

So in the case of Microsoft it controlled so many of the world's computers, that by controlling the software they ran on these machines, they were able to control the Internet, killing any innovation or improvement that a competitor could cause. Moreover what Microsoft was choosing was to not invest on the internet, and by extension, not allowing anyone else to either. This is why after the anti-trust case you saw a browser renaissance followed by an explosion of web improvements.

Here this won't trigger any change. Apple has a strong position, but they don't quite have that much power on the markets. Apple has dragged its feet on a lot of features and software that first came to Android and then decided to catch up.

Take the keyboard, for example. Android is very open and lets people install different keyboards. The iPhone does not. Because of this Androids have had superior keyboards for a really long time. Even features that I consider critical (such as swipe to type) only came out on iOS 13.

Apple couldn't prevent someone inventing a better keyboard than they had, because there was competition with other phones. If Apple controlled 99% of the phones out there, you could argue that they're stifling the innovation in the field with no justification.

The difference is that in the current scenario Apple couldn't prevent keyboard innovations, and market dynamics made it such that Apple ended up copying features. In the anti-trust scenario no one could ever offer these alternatives because Apple would prevent them.

Similarly if the browsing experience is sub-par on iPhone, people will switch more and more to Android. Unless it happens that it doesn't matter and people don't care about it.

Anti-Trust is not about corporate freedom to do what they want on another platform (for that you want things like FCC's Title II). Anti-Trust is about not doing actions that prevent a fair market.

&gt; They said you could just make it a browser app which was eventually done, but apple gave Amazon a head start.

Apple didn't give them a head start. Amazon was the one that found the loophole. Apple simply validated it. Why didn't Google research this earlier? Maybe because they gave Android priority, and that's their prerogative to. Why didn't Nvidia or others? Maybe they didn't realize they could do this workaround, or didn't have enough experience understanding the rules of iOS. Amazon has apps on it, and doesn't have loyalty to one phone store over another.

&gt; The funny thing is that apple made these the rule changes as stadia and xcloud were about to be released to ios.

As a reaction to. And it's Apple's prerogative to do that. That's not anti-trust. The question is if Apple's actions are preventing the market dynamics.

Apple can make the argument that for people that want streaming games using stadia, they can always buy an Android. Just like someone who wants to play Gears of War can always buy an XBox, and this doesn't give Sony the ability to sue Microsoft for anti-trust. Exclusive media is not anti-trust because it's part of the package you can choose to buy or not. At that point were do we draw the line otherwise? Are menus? OS? The fact that I can't run iOS on my Android phone, does that mean there's an anti-trust case? What about the fact that I can't run Windows? Or DOS?

&gt; Luna unsurprisingly is not available on android yet.

Not surprising at all. Those two companies have always clashed in their stores and protocols. But again not anti-trust.

&gt; Apple is willing to work with Amazon to allow no commission renting of movies because reasons.

That's their prerogative, and what Amazon may be giving them in exchange or not may be different. Again not anti-trust if it doesn't prevent market systems from changing. Android could always offer the killer feature iOS doesn't and take that sweet extra 25% of mobile users.

&gt; Apple is far worse than Microsoft.

Maybe, but the fact that a company does an anti-trust action doesn't mean all their actions are anti-trust.

&gt; Saying people can buy other devices is not a great argument of apple is arguing their store is more like steam than microsoft.

I think that it's not saying ""they can buy elsewhere"" but that ""EPIC is free to sell games on a myriad of platforms that are not the iOS store"" and that's enough to argue that this isn't anti-trust. If this actions result in iOS being an inferior platform for games, then games, and gamers, will move elsewhere.

&gt; Especially when both stores don't even have fortnite.

The argument isn't about fortnite. The argument is that EPIC wants to be able to milk users even more through micro-transactions on their phone systems. It just so happens that fortnite is in the right place strategically to make this argument: it's enough of a game (and not a slot machine with extra steps) that it could bring in sympathy of people (and fans), but fortnite has been losing popularity, so the risk of losing players in iOS (and only iOS) is small enough. But the goal is not fortnite, and it never was about that specific game.

The point is that EPIC has many alternatives they could use. They can pull their games of iOS and, if EPIC is right, it will be Apple's loss.

Or maybe not. Maybe the point is that people get access to a mobile platform, and that's a separate enough experience than you can't use consoles or PCs as alternatives. And you could also argue that, while Apple doesn't control the market of phones, it has a huge defacto influence by everyone targeting both, that if either Apple or Google say something doesn't go, then it just doesn't, independent of what the market would have preferred.

This isn't David vs. Goliath. And there isn't a good or a bad company. Here's two companies, making arguments (non of which are good for the consumers) out of their own greed. It's up to the court to decide if either is right.",1614228886.0,1
"Fair, but all the Apple has to say is that EPIC is free to create games and release them independent of Apple's choices. And that the market will decide what happens.

Note that Apple isn't punishing anyone for violating exclusivity. It's punishing someone for not playing with the rules of their platform. The consoles have them too.

The question is: is Apple's actions of regulating their Phone, letting them alter the decisions of the game's market? Is anyone incapable of creating and releasing their game without paying Apple because of Apple's decision? Hell can you say that it's *defacto impossible* to release a game without paying Apple because of Apple's actions? If Apple can prove that, it takes away credibility to the anti-trust argument.",1614229052.0,-1
"  Did anyone thing they would?     Right to repair needs to be enforced.  Apple and John Deere, two of the worst offenders need their feet held to the fire.",1614229540.0,-1
"&gt; Note that Apple isn't punishing anyone for violating exclusivity.

But they are.

Apple only has so much ability to say ""It was your choice to violate my rules."" on a platform of general use that they control. A rough guide on how to think of it from a legal standpoint is that if the existence and enforcement of a rule is entirely about the rule-creator making money and the punishment involves the rule-creator making less money, then this has the potential to run afoul of monopoly laws. Obviously that statement is overly broad but it's purpose still stands.

In particular, one point that was raised early on is that Apple's ecosystem is a further difference between them and Microsoft or Sony or Nintendo with their consoles. And that's that those three companies vet every single game that is releasing on their consoles commercially. You don't get to pump out XBOX CDs for your game without the Microsoft certification, which includes both a technical side (they make sure that my game cannot brick your console) and a content side. Though generally used sparingly, all three companies can and will block games with content they do not agree with. Meanwhile with Apple, their automated vetting system is streamlined to do a quick ""Does it seem like this app is accessing parts of the phone we said people shouldn't?"" and some basic technical safety checks, before you get your rubber stamp of approval.

This is an extremely meaningful distinction, because it means that despite the variety they hold, Xbox, Playstaion, and Nintendo are closed ecosystem. You don't get to join without their say-so. But the Apple ecosystem is inherently an open ecosystem that they will remove you from if it later comes to their attention that you were violating their policies/desires. Open ecosystems don't get to have required membership fees AND be able to exclude members simply because the member in question is nibbling from their pie.

Apple has eternally played themselves as the weak and wounded underdog in a big mean nasty world of entrenched and wealthy monopolies. Apple owns 49% of the smartphone marketshare in the United States. It's not going to work this time.",1614231557.0,-1
"That's a bit of a strained argument.

And Apple is as much a closed ecosystem as anything else. So is Android, the whole point that in order to call your phone Android it has to have the Google Play Store and cannot have any other is because its a close ecosystem.

And Apple hasn't played themselves as weak or wounded. They are merely stating ""EPIC has no argument and they're acting hurt and weak when in reality they make a lot more money from elsewhere"". Apple isn't saying it's being bullied, but simply that it's not really bullying EPIC, it's just standing its ground.

Again how valid that is depends on the culture.

&gt; Apple owns 49% of the smartphone marketshare in the United States

If 50% of computers were Apple, you could argue that Apple would want to have superior browsers, like Netscape, on their OS to put pressure on their competition. Better browsers means better computers. Again market dynamics would hold then.

The problem was that at that time Microsoft software controlled almost all the PCs at the time. Both in Europe and the US.

Now Apple is no one's friend, or hero. They talk about privacy, but merely they talk about how, since they don't make money certain way, they don't do the shitty actions that making money that way requires. But at the same time they fight others.

You want good anti-trust cases? Lets talk about Apple controlling the production of hardware (that's in China though, limited in the US or EU). Or about Apple's byzantine actions against repairable devices. When Apple forbids manufacturers of their parts to sell parts to other people (to prevent repair and replacement of them) that's an anti-trust action. The consumer is limited on what can and cannot be repaired by Apple's actions. While Apple can choose to not sell the parts it produces, it cannot tell it's providers who they can sell to or not. That actually has [clear cut examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastman_Kodak_Co._v._Image_Technical_Services,_Inc.).

But the guys who get hurt by this are not multi-billion companies, so they don't have the resources to push an anti-trust case.

I'm not taking sides here. EPIC's argument is not strong, at least not as presented. Things may change in the future as more evidence comes up and the case is better formed.

So again, is Apple doing an anti-trust action here? That depends on how the court looks at it. Is EPIC out of line here? That depends on how the court looks at it.

Is it wrong that EPIC is pushing this? Not really, if they believe they have a case they have the right (and obligation) to push it. It's up to the court to either agree with them or not. Is Apple a victim here? No. Is EPIC a victim here? No.

Apple controls their OS with an iron fist, Google does not.

Apple pretends their app-store is a closed ecosystem when it isn't, Google does not.

This is not a good comparison.

&gt; If 50% of computers were Apple, you could argue that Apple would want to have superior browsers, like Netscape, on their OS to put pressure on their competition. Better browsers means better computers. Again market dynamics would hold then.

Steve Jobs himself once gave a lovely speech that the problem with reaching the top market share is that the opposite is true. Once you have captured the majority of the market, technical innovations and quality of life improvements result in measurably smaller market gains, whereas increased sales programs are now primarily responsible for increased market share. Your product is already the top product, people believe this to be true. They want it because they already know it's the best. Making it better doesn't alter that reputation. People adopt it because you manage to convince them to and once something has the public status of 'the best' it doesn't matter if it isn't anymore because the average person doesn't take the time to research that. What innovation does, is increase costs for a company that is now only concerned with increasing profits, which can be done by finding a few more drops of blood to squeeze out of the stone of market share or by cutting costs. An 8K screen is going to convince basically nobody to get a new iPhone, so why bother spending billions figuring out how to make an energy efficient 8K screen for the next iPhone?

What happens is that innovation gradually gets turned down more and more, while sales increase because more effort is being pushed into sales. And this teetering house of cards comes crashing down when all of a sudden huge portions of your customer base realize that the other products out there are just vastly superior because you spent so long resting on your laurels that any innovation you once had is last years news. And thus you get the fall of IBM, Xerox, etc.

&gt; The problem was that at that time Microsoft software controlled almost all the PCs at the time. Both in Europe and the US.

And they CONSTANTLY were hit with lawsuits based around limiting their monopolistic behaviors and activities. And you know what? They lost a LOT of those cases, or in many situations what could be said is that even when they didn't outright lose, they also didn't outright win the case which given the relative positions of Microsoft and their opponent (usually Apple) was as good as losing.

Oh of course EPIC doesn't give a shit about the end user, but this is one of those (rare) cases where what's good for one billion dollar company is inherently good for the rest of us. If they win, then the likely result is that Apple may no longer expel developers from in-app microtransactions that Apple gets no cut of (relatively low chance of this one), combined with not being able to expel developers for simultaneously having their apps on non-Apple owned app stores (high chance).

The end result is that alternate app-stores on the iPhone gain a flood of content overnight and they become much more likely to be used by consumers (despite the technical knowhow necessary to jailbreak the phone and access them).

Also, they made major changes (admittedly, improvements) to the ARM architecture to the point where sideways compatibility is a problem from a developer standpoint.

"It’s not just facebook. It’s about all the online services at the top of users per month lists. Most of the counter arguments to this are revolving around some notion of nature vibes “technology bad, hold the line, they can’t make me” drifting further down into weirdo territory the longer the discussion goes. If you have a company/are self employed, not using social media is a ridiculous thought at this point. In corporate ranks, pretty much everyone uses some social media services (linkedin, xing) to stay connected. From school ages to college, you’re making yourself a social outcast if you don’t use any of the popular services. If you don’t use calendar, note-taking, link collection, todo-list, email, file hosting/sharing and perhaps some more apps usually called “productivity” apps and swear on your analog notebook being just as good, you’re kidding yourself and leave advantages on the table directly reducing your free time (and I suppose we can agree on free time being among the most valuable things we can have).

Example for facebook services...I’m jn the process of trying to get rid of facebook’s whatsapp entirely, but there are people who are only reachable through either facebook directly or that. Should I make myself harder to reach for them and cut out my easiest way to contact them (I’m fine with any, but it’s how they communicate)? They can “hardly function” without facebook’s services in a modern way. My parents and their friends can barely use whatsapp, are happy about it and that level of connectivity between them is a huge gain for them. Friends in university basically all use facebook to stay up to date on social stuff and in contact. The more social the people are, the more likely they use this stuff. Average technology users are faring far worse than you think when you assume people can easily function normally without those services once they know the advantages.

It’s the last facebook product I use and I can function without facebook, but gotta be real...google, microsoft, apple and reddit still got me as well as facebook keeping my data through contact lists of other people using it, my old data, mapping to website tracking data where they can (already using all sorts of blockers) and buying/exchanging with other companies. Then all the companies they sold their data to got it and they share and correlate everything they can.

"&gt;Do you own an iPhone btw? Apple is the worst of the worst, up there with Facebook.

For what it's worth, no, I don't.  I have an android, which isn't much better, but I do buy second hand so that I'm not directly supporting them by buying new, however I understand that I'm not doing the best job I can, either.  Furthermore, I also have a list of companies that I stay away from as best as possible due to their history of shitty practices and human rights violations, as well as a list of entertainers whom I no longer support, people like Chris Brown, R. Kelly, and Kevin Spacey, to name just a few.

I was raised in the south and I grew up watching college and pro football and basketball.  Once I was old enough to understand what was going on in those industries I stopped because I don't agree with what they do.  My sister bought me a beanie with my favorite college team's logo on it a few years back for Christmas, and I don't even wear it because I wouldn't want to give anyone the idea that it is OK to support them or the industry in general.  

Am I perfect?  Fuck no, but I know that, and I'm always trying to be better.  That's the problem we seem to be having here.  You believe that you are living some perfect life where everything you do has no impact on the world around you.  You think that going out and telling people to plant more trees is negating the fact that there is a 12 year old in a sweat shop making shoes for the basketball player you just got done talking to reddit about.  Your support, whether passive or active is still support, make no mistake.  I'll state it once more, you don't have to like it.  You just have to stop lying to yourself that you aren't doing it.

"That’s interesting. At the same time, I feel like part of the reason for that is so people can’t resell a “working” iPhone with a crappy knockoff screen that will break as well as the device no longer having its ipx water resistance rating.

That sounds similar to modern transmissions, they now come sealed and are unable to be serviced without special, dealer only tools. Some people have made it work with adapters and it doesn’t brick your car when you do this, however

At the same time though, phones are considered more of a 2-3 year lifespan consumable at 700-1000 dollars compared to these tractors that are expected to last upwards of 15 years and cost in the hundreds of thousands (for some of them)

Also either the government forces Apple to sell their parts to third party sellers, which I find a really weird thing to legislate, or the government forces Apple to allow 3rd party iPhone parts to be able to be installed into their devices. Both of those solutions seem bad. People like Louis Rossmann love to make it seem like this is a freedom restricting, money grabbing scheme by Apple. But it isn’t that simple.

"There are very easy ways to make a phone reject counterfeit parts without rejecting genuine ones.

Also, for almost all intents and purposes it's cheaper to source parts from e-waste recyclers than it is to construct your own knockoff screen fab.

Sealed transmissions are designed to outlive the rest of the car that's around them. On the other hand, most phones will have their lifespan restricted by battery cycles. Without making the battery removable, there are ways to make the battery serviceable by not welding it to the PCB or gluing it to the PCB end to end. There's no reason to do this except to prevent servicing.

"The best scenario I can give you is this particular one that made me loathe Apple for the rest of my days: Broken charging port while on vacation with an iPhone 6. I was at 3% when I came to the hotel and phone wouldn't charge.

I can't send over my phone to Apple, since I'd lose 14 days vacation pics. (No internet, it was a horseback trip through Mongolia, had maybe 2 opportunities to do so at net cafes and it was too slow to upload full-res backups)

Well I got it repaired by this lovely store who was able to repair it temporarily by welding a PSU to the internals of the phone.
This same shop got shut down by Apple and the owner was sued by Apple for 2+ million dollars for making and publishing a tool that would mimic the Apple tool and allow you to switch out iPhone camera lenses for other Apple camera lenses.

I used to work for a big Telecom company and one of our big profit margin items was phone insurance through a company called Asurion. There is currently a class-action lawsuit against Asurion because they didn't ensure that the data storage wasn't properly wiped or rendered inoperable before sending it to e-waste recyclers.
Most people with Android phones still do not encrypt their primary partition to this day...
(I Know this isn't Apple specifically, but this is an industry-wide phenomenon. Asurion insured all phones through that carrier, including Apple devices)

Also, again, your argument that this would open the floodgates to non-genuine parts is bullshit and, at this point, probably made in bad faith. 
First, it's already cheaper to get genuine parts from recyclers. Second, what Right to Repair does is force the manufacturer to sell their genuine parts to consumers at a reasonable margin.

What I don’t think is reasonable is you insinuating that apple is the only manufacturer that does what you’re talking about. Also, while it’s a valid reason for you to not like apple, it doesn’t seem right to spread the gospel of apple hate over your phone breaking and putting you in a bind when any other manufacturers device would’ve likely done the same.

Also, unless I’m mistaken, asurion explicitly tells you you *won’t* get your device back and that should be evident when you receive a device to replace it.

"About the scandal: phones crash and shut down if the battery is degraded and can’t handle the CPU at max. Apple added an option to turn off throttling after they were “exposed” and that means exactly that turning off the throttling will make your phone crash instantly upon turning on apps. This isn’t an Apple thing, if you buy a 250 watt PSU for your computer and turn on a program that uses more electricity, your PC will crash upon opening it. If Apple didn’t throttle, people would say: the phones crash when the battery ages, they want you to buy a new phone! Now we have the option to make our phones crash so I guess exposing Apple made the consumer win.

As far as changing the screen and battery being security issues, the screen and fingerprint sensor come together, they’re one piece. If you changed the screen, meaning you change the fingerprint sensor as well, anyone could change it and gain access to an iPhone via hardware. I have another comment you can read here about the battery.

As far as Rossman goes, whether you like him or dislike him, you have to realize that making videos about repairing your own phone does not affect his business interests, it in fact serves as a really good advertisement of his expertise.

"&gt; Your argument is that giving consumers more choice is somehow removing a choice?

Not my words at all, just the way you’ve colored this issue in your mind because you haven’t thought it through due to a lack if information.

&gt; Look, if you have a preference for both a certain hardware and ecosystem you would still have that in a more open platform. If you want to exclusively use Apple hardware, Apple software, and have your Apple devices only repaired by Apple technicians, then you would still be able to do that even if other people were able to use different software and repair on their own with different hardware. Having the option to download a different store on your Iphone or put a different battery in your Ipad is not forcing you to use those options.

I don’t want those options on an Apple device. That’s one of the reasons me and many others buy Apple devices. Before you stereotype me - I also buy non-Apple devices for when I want a more open ecosystem. I’ve been a linux user since the 90s and am a very strong privacy and consumer rights advocate. I like open designs a lot - for some tasks. I like having the choice. 

I want my kids to use a device that has a closed and filtered ecosystem. I also want some devices that I rely on to only allow OEM locked-in parts because I want full assurance that there is a path of responsibility if something goes wrong.

You’re currently free to make an open product and buy an open product as it stands, but you want to take away the choice of having a closed product because you don’t realize why this is a bad idea. Here are 3 important reasons to consider:

1. There are inter-related security, reliability, safety, and cost advantages to a closed system. 

2. Repairability guidelines will impact start-up and continued development costs which *will* limit the number of product and brand choices on the market.

3. The concept of consumer “repairability” is poorly defined -  where the line is drawn and how that affects development costs is going to a highly contentious issue - particularly with respect to software.

Versus Tim Cook today who has the same shit eating grin with every keynote spouting “and you’re gonna love it” while knowing it’s a product built on compromise and deplorable metrics.

No one field is so impressive to be an expert in that it should be perceived as being a universal expert, let alone neuroscience. It’s just another field of complex problem solving.

"I'm very well aware of their business model, are you? You understand this is not about data it's about brand positioning only, right?

One example:

""Apple, too, has benefited from just doing business with the biggest privacy offenders in the tech sector. Despite Cook’s claim in Brussels that the “stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them,” Apple does lots of deals with those companies. Safari, the web browser that comes with every iPhone, is set up by default to route web searches through Google. For this privilege, Google reportedly paid Apple $9 billion in 2018, and as much as $12 billion this year. All those searches help funnel out enormous volumes of data on Apple’s users, from which Google extracts huge profits. Apple might not be directly responsible for the questionable use of that data by Google, but it facilitates the activity by making Google its default search engine, enriching itself substantially in the process.

The same could be said for the apps Apple distributes. Companies such as Google and Facebook get access to iPhone users by offering their apps—Messenger, Gmail, Google Maps, and so on—for download from the Apple App Store. Most cost consumers nothing, because they exist to trade software services, such as email or mapping, for data. That business model helped stimulate the data-privacy dystopia we now occupy.

.....Tim Cook talks a big game, but at the end of the day, his company is allowing the surveillance-capitalism atrocities it claims to oppose. It sometimes helps people find alternatives in its own services, but far more often, it fails to prevent its customers from being harmed by companies such as Google and Facebook—in part because it provides, endorses, and profits from their use.

No matter what it says, Apple is not a company committed to data privacy.

Facebook at the moment can track what apps you use and what apps you came from so like if you tap a link to Facebook from say, subway surfers they will know how long you were on the game and stuff.

"It's kind of funny defending apple because you can't technically use an alternative browser to Safari on iOS.  Every alternative browser you can download on the app store is just UX added on top of a featureless safari frame.  Even more, the safari frame has performance optimizations turned off as an app component in other apps.  There is a process for web rendering and it includes all kinds of javascript caching etc. you cannot enable in your alternate browser.  So if you install firefox on ios, even though it forced into using the same safari renderer, it runs slower.  Which is literally what microsoft was sued over with Internet Explorer.  It's not only that it was preinstalled, it was also using APIs that made it run quicker than other browsers did.

There is no technical reason for this, the gecko renderer, V8, etc. can run on ios, forward caching and all, but apple just denies you from ever installing it by banning all other browser frameworks from the app store.

"You're kind of missing the forest for the tress here. Is there no fault on Apple for selecting a battery with insufficient durability that fails to power the SoC over a lifetime of regular use? Is there no fault on Apple for designing said battery to be difficult to replace for consumers and 3rd party repair services, effectively monopolizing repair on products with their brand? 

The reality is that the issue with that phone *isn't* normal. It is true that underfeeding any chip leads to instability, but not every model of phone exhibits this issue. I've used phones three and four years old, and while capacity always drops, power delivery leading to crashes is not as common. In your analogy, you mention that a 250w PSU will cause any normal PC to fart out in the same way. This is true, but someone has to make the incredibly uninformed decision to install a 250w PSU in the first place. In this case, Apple was the one who made that decision by failing to ensure their product continued to function with processing power *as advertised* throughout a reasonable lifespan. 

If Apple didn't throttle, people would say exactly what you predicted they would say, and they would still be right. The issue remains that a specific generation of iPhones suffer from a hardware fault that is artificially unable to be circumvented by the consumer. From the very start, there would be no issue if phones were designed to last with easily replaceable or serviceable batteries, and we're all old enough to remember that this was once the norm.

"The Verge article I linked was actually not the same news.

Here's the text of the WSJ article:

[Apple](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AAPL) Inc. is pursuing its own plans to [limit tracking of app usage](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-to-roll-out-privacy-measures-despite-facebook-objections-11611810002?mod=article_inline) by requiring developers to get opt-in permission from users before collecting an advertising identifier for iPhones. At the same time, European Union privacy regulators have [fielded multiple complaints](https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-eye-the-auctions-that-decide-which-web-ads-you-see-11562670006?mod=article_inline) about the information that websites share with third parties about what content users are viewing as part of such tracking.

One set of complaints comes from Brave Software Inc., maker of a privacy-focused web browser, where Google’s Mr. Temkin was chief product officer until last summer. Google says Mr. Temkin’s involvement in its plan demonstrates its commitment to user privacy. Brave didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Google’s changes come as big tech companies face multiple antitrust investigations. Smaller digital-ad companies that use cross-site tracking have accused Apple and Google of using privacy as a pretext for changes that hurt competitors. And Facebook Inc. Chief Executive [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/mark-zuckerberg) in January said in an earnings call that “[Apple has every incentive](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-privacy-change-will-hit-facebooks-core-ad-business-heres-how-11611938750?mod=article_inline) to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work.”

In the U.K., the Competition and Markets Authority, the country’s top antitrust regulator, last month [opened a formal probe](https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-chrome-privacy-plan-faces-u-k-competition-probe-11610119589?mod=article_inline) into Google’s phasing out of third-party cookies from its Chrome browser. The probe stemmed from a complaint from a group of marketers that argued Google’s plan would cement the company’s heft in the online advertising space.

A Google spokesman said the company has been briefing the U.K.’s CMA on its plan to end its own use of unique tracking across multiple websites.

Google’s announcement complicates advertising-industry efforts to come up with an alternative, more privacy-friendly technology for targeting individual consumers, such as the one being led by the Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media, a group of advertisers and advertising technology companies, that would rely on new identifiers, like strings of numbers and letters derived from users’ email addresses. Without mentioning the partnership’s effort directly, Mr. Temkin referred to identifiers “based on people’s email addresses” as examples of tools Google won’t use.

Google acknowledged that other companies may push ahead with other ways to track users. Companies that use parts of Google’s advertising infrastructure, such as its ad exchange, could potentially still sell ads that use their own unique identifiers, Google said. But the company said it won’t use or invest in such tools for ads it sells.

“We realize this means other providers may offer a level of user identity for ad tracking across the web that we will not,” Mr. Temkin wrote in the blog post. “We don’t believe these solutions will meet rising consumer expectations for privacy, nor will they stand up to rapidly evolving regulatory restrictions.”

There are exceptions to Google’s plan. The company’s limit on unique tracking identifiers doesn’t extend to so-called first-party data—information a company gets directly from a customer. For instance, websites will be able to sell ads based on users’ activity only on that specific site.

It also means Google will continue to allow advertisers to aim ads on Google services like YouTube at specific clients for whom they already have contact information. But when the changes go into effect, Google will stop targeting such ads at those people when they are browsing other websites.

But the damage was done - all the obnoxious shit that advertisers tried to do over those years cemented the fact that ad blockers were the only way to browse the internet, and they just kept getting more ubiquitous or built-in to existing browsers.

The various companies shilling those shitty ads bit the hand that feeds and then paid the price.

the problem is that it really doesn't take many data points to narrow it down to a single actual person; IP address / city, age and gender will usually do it.

people outside of ad tech have no conception of what that leaks out of Android devices. e.g., when you run an app for the first time, it will send every kind of device identifier, your email address, and *a list of every app you currently have installed or uninstalled but still on your library list.* if you don't want to be tracked, they send the same data, except ""donottrack"":1 instead of 0.

They may not be 100% sure of their success, but that they ""absolutely would not"" fuck around in this manner is another question entirely. They're willing to gamble with regards to Epic, for example.

We have to remember Apple is doing this inside of their iOS app ecosystem. We don't know the ultimate outcome of their fight vs Epic, but they've had some things go their way during the fight. I'm assuming that the outcome of that may have some bearing on the legal landscape and Apple's appetite to do these kinds of things.

But, remember, Apple is only letting the users *give permission* for ad tracking. It's not an unseen, default block. If someone downloads the Facebook app, the user can say yes if they want to. It's also Apple's app store. Monetizing the user data of the app store, after ""safely managing and anonymizing it"" (or however they would spin this), would certainly be in their purview. And if advertisers want the information, they can get it how Apple gives it, or they don't have to buy it. The argument might be that it wouldn't be monopolistic in the sense that the entire internet is available to the advertising ecosystem.

Now, I agree with you in a sense. Something like that *should* trigger lawsuits and antitrust investigations, and Apple has to be aware of that. But with several hundred million dollars between the couch cushions in a Cupertino spaceship campus for legal fees, combined with halfway decent excuses (""our app store, our data"", ""give the users the choice to share"", ""something something GDPR""), I wouldn't be surprised to see them at least give it a shot.",1614893260.0,1

Maybe you bought the iPhone because everyone else has one, or because you like it’s simple UI and ease of use, or because you have a personal belief that it is superior to Android for whatever reason - regardless, as a consumer you should not have to make a decision on the basis of repairability because the right to repair should be fundamental to owning a product, whatever that product may be.",1614898628.0,1

"EA was the one that made me realize the ""publisher"" distinction almost 30 years ago...

My thoughts at the time:

* Origin games started to suck, at about the same time this Cube/Cylinder/Sphere splash-screen became part of the load sequence...
* Same happened to Bullfrog...
* What is this ""Electronic Arts""? The publisher I guess... why does it seem to affect the games, don't they just manufacture/distribute!?

I didn't fully understand the invasive role of publishers yet, but I decided to avoid games with EA branding. Boycott, really.

Funny thing is I ended up in gamedev and worked for EA *twice* even though I never wanted to. And learned a lot more about why and how this happens with EA acquisitions (it usually isn't intentionally malicious, yet very common that things turn bad).

So, when were they making good games? I feel like it was sometime in the 80's but I didn't have a popular system like Commodore or Apple, so I never saw this EA.

Over the years they have published some good games, but my impression (limited, since I avoid EA titles) is that most of those were late in the dev-cycle, so they basically bought up a nearly finished game (plus studio) and reaped the rewards and brand-recognition. It's also possible for a studio to avoid having EA step-in on design, or force a broken release... if/while they keep all the bean counters happy, and have the leverage to keep EA's wannabe-designers at bay.",1615222887.0,1

"Pretty well balanced article, specifically on keeping devices out of landfills. I disagree on one item though: phones.

Security of computer systems doesn’t exist without physical security.

IMO Apple has incorporated this into their phone designs. They don’t want anyone but them opening their phones, yes they then get all the repair dollars but this also enhances security.

For example: afaik if you disconnect the thumbprint reader from an iphone it will refuse to communicate with any thumbprint reader until it’s told to do so by Apple maintenance hardware in an Apple-certified facility. That prevents anyone from reverse engineering the device, say by inserting logic analyzer leads in the connection and mapping the protocol, or by just replacing the thumbprint reader with a fake that lets your data be accessed without your consent.

If not for this approach by Apple then criminals and law enforcement alike would have tons of ‘readers’ that could side step the Apple security devices.

"? I don't know much about packet sending technology... but when you go back in history you'll find a continual back and forth between private and public funded (think Thomas Edison, James Maxwell, Ben Franklin)...but today there is a clear trend, and a plausible explanation for why public research is more innovative at 'basic' research.

Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Google are all the result of quite low hanging fruit (a cheap computer knocked together in a garage, a BASIC designed for an existing computer, a social media platform with better 'design' than its competitors, an improvement to search engines derived at a university).

These are the 'types' of innovation the private sector excels at, where one existing product hasn't quite managed to become cheap enough or easy enough for the general public to enjoy. And if you look at the results, you see how vastly disproportional the profits are to the 'contribution'... Facebook being the most egregious example... a handful of people offering a product with no 'technical' innovation gets to become a multi-billion dollar company, while those that laid the foundation get nothing (not the inventor of the WWW (Tim Bernard Lee), the Internet (Darpa), or the packet switching developer).

Take as an example the recent resurgence in Artificial intelligence, you will find examples of Private contribution particularly as you go back in history to around the time of WW2 (but again there is a reason for that, with massive Public subsidy at the time)... but overwhelmingly you find all roads lead back to a few academic in Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun, etc. Their work in the 1990, 2000's was not privately funded, as the private sector had no idea it was going to work... its too risk adverse and very hard to retain the profits.

Now you can 'imagine' the private sector eventually cracking the problems that Hinton and LeCun did... but there is a clear pattern in the types of innovation that the public sector creates, and they are important enough not to be interfered with... I don't know how to assign an economic value to Einstein, Turing or Maxwell (but it is immense) and neither does the Private sector.",1615290404.0,1

"&gt;This is just not true. 

What part? Your response is a non sequitur. 

&gt;For example, Google has absolutely no problem running fibers across all their data centers, POPs, undersea, etc. 

Google does virtually none of that. Google is not a [backbone provider](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3532318/what-is-the-internet-backbone-and-how-it-works.html):

""The individual core networks are privately owned by Tier 1 internet service providers (ISP), giant carriers whose networks are tied together. These providers include AT&amp;T, CenturyLink, Cogent Communications, Deutsche Telekom, Global Telecom and Technology (GTT), NTT Communications, Sprint, Tata Communications, Telecom Italia Sparkle, Telia Carrier, and Verizon.""

&gt;But the last mile didn't work. 

Yes it did. As I have repeatedly said, the last mile is a gimmie because aerials, weather coax or fiber, are relatively cheap. It's only expensive if new poles have to be installed, which is usually only any issue in rural areas. 

Is case I haven't said this before, I've worked for ISPs (AT&amp;T, Comcast, etc.) and I was personally involved with the Google Fiber rollout in Austin, TX. 

In Austin Google Fiber did little trenching on their own. They tried to coax and cajole the City of Austin into paying for trenching with the promise of tech jobs, and the City of Austin did do some trenching for Google Fiber. 

Google Fiber was doomed to fail. The entire business model was based on getting MUNICIPAL / CITY governments to pay for all the trenching, again, 90% of costs. The cities balked at this, as they have many times in the past, and Google Fiber failed.

Verizon FiOS failed for the same reason. The glacial rollout of AT&amp;T GigaPower is a token effort, and AT&amp;T got Apple to pay for a lot of it (at least in Cupertino, CA and Austin, TX where Apple has campuses). 

&gt;Running fiber between offices and data centers is often done. 

By the companies I listed above, at great expense. It's worth it to pay $1 million+ USD to wire a datacenter. It is not worth $1 million+ USD  to wire a handful of homes. 

&gt;Running a fiber PER ISP per house? Come on now...

Yes, that's more or less what it means.

Trenching has to be done to the local node or ""neighborhood"", exactly how many houses / apartments that translates to varies wildly. I can't say ""1 node = 50 customers"" because that depends on density. In Manhattan that could be 500+ customers, but for a single house down a country road that could literally be 1 customer. I personally know someone in the Santa Cruz, CA mountains that paid $1 million+ USD to run fiber to 1 house.

Does that clarify why running fiber to suburban and rural homes isn't profitable?",1615300003.0,-1

Is it the case these people could not have made their contributions in the private sector? 

This is the issue I have with this line of reasoning: it still seems to rely on conflating necessary and sufficient conditions. 

&gt;The US spends less than 1% of tax on the Sciences (if i've read correctly)... I don't see why giving back that 1% would make the private sector any more capable of producing research as valuable.

Federal funding for R&amp;D was 128 billion in 2018. 17% of total R&amp;D funding is for basic research, but recently the US government fell to 42% of funding basic research, where in 2017 they did 54%. 

Far too much of federal funding of research is into military research, and we don't really need more effective bombs or the means of delivering them anytime soon.

&gt;Given that companies with cash reserves as vast as Apple, still haven't developed a 'revolutionary' battery... yet the public sector supports decades long endeavours into unproven technology such as graphene

No one has developed a ""revolutionary battery"" because batteries are close to their theoretical limit as is. The remaining revolutions are in the mining and refining of materials for them. 

This is also the reason why relying on utility grade battery storage is foolhardy since the same materials will be used for EVs, and you will quickly get to a bottleneck for materials. Even with recent developments in needing less cobalt for LiBs, you will need lithium and nickel, and there's only so much in reserve and nickel's use is so pervasive you won't have enough for all the batteries needed for such a plan for some time. This would be less of an issue if more energy capacity would be focused on geothermal and nuclear, but politics is rarely if ever about solving technical problems with technical solutions, which makes for quite an obstacle for the public sector's incentives.

Graphene is quite a number of proven applications. The problem is like most polymers especially conductive ones the means of producing them at large scales is difficult and/or expensive.

&gt; it maybe a dead end technology, but again the risk incentives allow them to 'fail' at making commercials viable technologies. Again, this is why I think we've seen more recent 'revolutions' attributable to the public sector.

You're picking apart one word I used without addressing my point that as it stands, Bitcoin can't be used for the same purposes as money. The IRS certainly won't accept it to pay taxes. That means its value derives almost solely from demand, and that can be very dangerous. You might say that's how stocks work but while stocks can be largely driven by demand, they have a money-producing company behind them so while the stock price may deviate as a result of speculative investment (which is why they are often referred to as ""undervalued"" or ""overvalued""), there is an underlying ""fair"" price the value is tied to.

With Bitcoin, there is no ""fair"" price.

"You're right on some fronts - because of how rapidly the tech is becoming mainstream, there's absolutely a bubble around things like NFTs. 

However, the underlying blockchain tech on which all crypto runs is, IMO, the future of computing and networking. People get so fixated on the idea of cryptocurrency as just digital dollars, and when you think of it that way, of course it makes no sense. Why would I use BTC to pay for something and incur a $20 fee when I can use Venmo or Apple Pay, right?

That's the thing though - you can't just look at them as digital dollars, you have to think of them more abstractly, as stores of value. Bitcoin is like gold - it has some limited practical use, but it mainly acts as a store of value because it's finite and energy/effort/resource-intensive to obtain. Ethereum, on the other hand, uses a blockchain upon which decentralized apps and contracts can be built and executed, and then paid for using the coin.

This enables decentralized exchanges, like Compound and AAVE, where I can deposit currency, earn interest rates orders of magnitude better than any savings account, borrow against my deposits without any risk of lending discrimination or some invasive background check, and earn an ownership stake in the exchange itself via COMP or AAVE tokens, which both have monetary value based on the value of the exchange, but also give you voting rights when it comes to governing decisions of the exchange.

1) What's the difference to the end user? I know you don't know, so I'll tell you: There's a small transaction fee, and that's the downside. The upside is you have more control over crypto than you do dollars you have sitting in the bank. You can gain interest on it, and unlike the US dollar, its value isn't plummeting by the day. You can lend it on DeFi and make your crypto work for you. And I know you're not familiar with this stuff, but the sooner you learn about it, the better off you'll be.

2) Yes, some of these will actually support merchants getting paid in the crypto of their choice... Namely the patent from Square. I'm not sure which others will support it right off the bat, but they certainly won't be the only one.

3) It'll only be a matter of time until merchants skip out the middleman converting crypto to USD and just take direct payment in crypto

This is all happening on a very rapid timeline. Adoption is coming. Within a year you'll be able to hold crypto and pay for stuff with said crypto anywhere that accepts credit cards.

On the other hand, I don’t think they are incompetent. That hack was a big deal, but think about the threat model the NSA is under. They are public enemy #1 with some of the most cyber-warfare prone nations like NK, China, Russia, and to a certain extent India(not enemies but not really friends either). 

On top of invoking the wrath of foreign attacks, they are the Moby Dick of hack targets. The ultimate baddie of internet censorship/spying who happens to own a bunch of top-secret hacking tools. 

So just in terms of organizational competency, I think they deserve more credit than that. At their scale and threat level, it’s a miracle there haven’t been way more of these incidents. FAANG have breaches of this magnitude annually. 

On the other hand, like I said, they shouldn’t keep the bugs secret, because the odds that China or whatever having no knowledge of any given exploit are very low.

What Tesla and Microstrategy did buying bitcoin has no effect on their day to day operations.  This is free cash they are holding in bitcoin because of its deflationary properties.  There is no effect on their profit margin.  Although, ironically, Tesla has made more profit from buying bitcoin than they have selling cars.

The prices change with online stores and percentages and all that but the idea is the same you cannot expect to use a store for free and still have that store stay open epic themselves charge 15% (half the normal 30% majority of platforms stick to) but if that's a payment processing fee (like what they're alleging apple charges) why are they charging 15% when they argue apple should only do the 1.5%-3% that card issuers charge.

It was risky and Apple demanded sweetheart deals from the carriers (Cingular/AT&amp;T actually paid Apple a commission of each monthly bill for every original iPhone on their network).

"Of course it isn't.

There are many manufacturers who can build quality, reliable cars and who are working feverishly on electric cars, which require higher levels of software and control system integration to maximize performance.

And that's what Apple is good at—overall integration of existing technologies with a few choice new technologies that push the state of the art into a cohesive whole that just works, and that makes consumers happy.

Apple doesn't need to reinvent the wheel—they can just partner with people who already make the wheels, then overlay their advanced software and computing technologies to deliver something that just works better.

It's what Elon Musk has been chasing the whole time. Other manufacturers are also chasing it, but are at a noted disadvantage due to Tesla's significant head start.

"The average office worker in the United States must keep track of between 20 to 40 different username and password combinations. With so many passwords to remember, many of us use the same ones over and over, or have a running list of passwords saved somewhere. Passwords are a very serious and expensive security risk. It’s why companies like Microsoft , Apple and Google are trying to reduce our dependence on them. But the question is, can these companies break our bad habits?

Update (January 21, 2020): A website mentioned in this video, WeLeakInfo, was shut down by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies on Friday, Jan. 17, 2020. The site claimed to have more than 12 billion usernames and passwords from more than 10,000 data breaches.

Passwords are a very serious and expensive security risk. A report by Verizon looked at 2,013 confirmed data breaches and found that 29% of those breaches involved the use of stolen credentials.

Another study by the Ponemon Institute and IBM Security found that the average cost of a single data breach in the U.S. was more than $8 million. Even when passwords are not stolen, companies can lose a lot of money trying to reset them.

“Our research has shown that the average fully loaded cost of a help desk call to reset a password is anywhere between $40 or $50 per call,” says Merritt Maxim, vice president and research director at Forrester.

“Generally speaking, a typical employee contacts a help desk somewhere between 6 and 10 times a year on password related issues,” Maxim said. “So if you just do the simple multiplication of six to 10 times, times 50 dollars per call, times number of employees, in your organization, you’re talking significantly hundreds of thousands of dollars or even potentially millions of dollars a year.”",1615581285.0,1

"I see a blockchain being trustless and irreversible to be intrinsically linked. If blockchain transactions can be reversed, then users must trust the network to not just start reversing their transactions willy nilly. In that case it's no longer trustless. Also, you're looking at traditional banking systems all wrong. They're not perfect. *Sometimes* a person who screws up won't be able to fix their mistakes. But on a trustless blockchain, *every time* a person screws up, their mistake is made permanent. If any transaction goes through, then it's not a ""mistake,"" it's just a transaction, and there is no fixing that erroneous transaction *by design*. Since it's a trustless system, nobody else needs to trust that your attempts to reverse existing transactions on the network will be for legitimate reasons. You should simply not be allowed to do it.  

To address the second half of your reply, I think bitcoins being a solution in search of a problem is a perfectly valid point to bring up. In fact it is *the* point to bring up when discussing use cases. Think about what problem Satoshi's protocol is solving. Bitcoins solves the problem of how to create a network where users can have confidence their transactions are processed without relying on a central authority to verify the process. He solved that problem by distributing the authority to say what is and isn't a valid transaction on the ledger across the entire network. That's great. But take a step back and try to answer the question, ""who actually needs a trustless transaction network?"" If you find yourself reaching to try and come up with an answer that would include even a significant portion of the public, then you've stumbled upon a solution in search of a problem. *Most people* don't need trustless irreversibility. In fact they need the exact opposite, reversibility at the hands of a trusted central authority. Most people do not have a problem that the protocol could ever solve for them. A trustless financial network is simply not a solution they'll ever need.  

People not being able to find a good use case for mass adoption of a new technology is in no way a guarantee that the technology *must* one day find widespread adoption. When the Xerox Alto prototype home computer was created in 1973, very few people at that time could imagine how important PCs would one day become in our lives. But by 1977 the first Apple IIs had hit the market, and by the mid 1980s PCs were already hitting their stride. Bitcoins came out in 2009. It is now 2021, and even you agree the technology as it exists today is still by and large useless. You know what else was invented ages ago, and remains mostly useless? [Pykrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pykrete). Insisting that a construction material which starts falling apart above the melting temperature of water will one day revolutionize material science and construction is to me not that different to insisting that a trustless transaction network which can never reverse any transactions by design will one day revolutionize existing banking and e-commerce systems. The very thing that makes them special is also what makes them useless to the public.",1615726171.0,1

"&gt;	DNT is not widely adopted by the industry, with companies citing the lack of legal mandates for its use, as well as unclear standards and guidelines for how websites are to interpret the header. Thus, it is not guaranteed that enabling DNT will actually have any effect at all.[10] The W3C disbanded its DNT working group in January 2019, citing insufficient support and adoption.[11] Apple discontinued support for DNT the following month.[12]

And GPC was just announced last year. Which means until the standard is finalized it run the risk of falling into the exact same hole of DNT. With respect to browsers, developers often get annoyed when browsers enable features that aren't standardized because it creates the IE problem where developers are supporting ""that thing, and then everything else"". 

Idk if you're a developer at all, or familiar with that space. But it happened not that long ago with CSS Grid, Microsoft had the only browser that was actually supporting the spec. The other browsers all kept working on it behind the scenes and then it made Microsoft look odd. People don't like ending up in these situations, so as it stands, browsers generally wait until features are *finalized* finalized before releasing a new API/whatever (excluding behind feature flags) so the internet does break, and implementation is consistent. 

See the IE section here. This references it, I can't find any articles anymore talking about the whole story. But this isn't the first time it's happened. Javascript as a whole had that issue as well

"Attacks on proprietary software at the development level are more likely to be successful because a multitude of services designed to detect potential backdoors are supplied for free only to open source projects. Said services can be used with or without the consent of the upstream projects by third parties too. That is in addition to key upstream projects being formally audited by multiple independent companies to be certified as safe for US military use. Throw reproducible builds and sandboxed third party build servers into the mix and attacks against open source projects get even harder still when compared to proprietary ones.

Remember the “Netscape is for weenies” backdoor in specific IIS extensions? How about the HP secret undocumented password backdoors? The blatant weakening of the security in Juniper products? How Hikvision cameras had multiple backdoors added over the years? How about when CCleaner had their code replaced to include malware, yet still being signed with the usual cert? How about the time when macOS shipped with the ability to login as root without a password? How about the legion of unknowingly infected iOS software because developers used dodgy copies of development tools?

A copy of openVAS would have likely detected the macOS snafu during testing (as it was a blank root password). But since nobody at Apple had an automated pipeline running simple tests against new builds based upon an out-of-the-box configuration, the backdoor which got inserted by a developer went undetected. A comparable open source project (e.g. Debian) will have many, many security researchers hammering the unstable tree as it receives commits across tens of thousands of packages, ready to jump at the chance to claim 15 minutes of fame should something obvious find its way downstream.  

With all that said, the cryptographic security checks surrounding software binaries is better on the proprietary OSes (where binaries are always checked at runtime before they’re allowed to execute) than on the open source ones like Linux (binaries are only checked at install time). Also, npm, pip... all this modern agile crap is a security hellhole and the way people are embracing container systems like docker so readily... it will only be a matter of time before SolarWinds statement starts to become true if the open source community isn’t careful.",1615763645.0,1

Google doesnt literally have a folder with all of your personal info in it that is then sold off to just everyone out there. An advertiser will tell them what criteria they want to meet for their ads, an algorithm then shows that ad to people that meet the criteria. If you see an ad it doesnt mean that that company now has your info.",1615879851.0,1
"No, not really. People have this massive misconception that the data google collects is seen by humans and used and sold off to companies. When really its just a bunch of anonymous data in a computer that is used to target ads. And this misconception is then fueled by companies like apple and their fantics, along with other companies like Mozilla who literally have no way to compete with google services other than misdirecting people into using their own services because ""they care about your privacy"".",1615880048.0,1
"I feel people are hugely overblowing this situation, much like DDG are for the purposes of garnering support.

All the privacy disclosures on the App Store mean is that Google might use that information for their app functionality.

Let’s take a look at a couple as example. The Google chrome app collects browsing history for product personalization, app functionality and analytics. Is that unexpected? Not really. The app must collect browsing history to be able to show you your search history, for example. This comes under app functionality and product personalization. Analytics is maybe a bit more scary, but what do you really expect for an app that is run by a search engine?

Let’s also look at location. Again, this sounds scary, is Google tracking me 24/7? Again no. Privacy disclosures do not mean they ARE collecting this data, just that they might through usage of the app. Why might they need access to location? When you go to a site that allows searching by location, chrome will ask if you want to send the location to that website. You can absolutely say no, and on iOS you can absolutely say “deny” to chrome knowing your location. Chrome only gets that data when you tell it you want to share it with chrome.

Financial info - only if you pay for things through Apple Pay in chrome.

Audio content - only if you use audio search, again you have to explicitly give Google access to the microphone. That audio must be interpreted on Google’s servers and turned into a search string.

The Google app lists “contacts”, but again you have to explicitly give the app access to contacts when it asks. 

Photos and videos, again used for uploads, again you can give Google no access, access to specific photos, or access to all photos.

User ID, this one sounds the most scary, like Google is tracking you individually. But in reality if you’ve ever published an iOS app, the privacy disclosure asks if you use account logins in your app, if you do, then you get the user ID tag. Device ID, likewise, is also used for identifying individual devices, which can be useful for security (although unique sessions is better). Device ID is probably the most scary thing on this list.

Sure, many of these things sound scary, but 90% of them are innocuous, and literally required for app functionality. You can’t really use Google as it is today, but also demand it collects no information from its users - that information is WHY Google is a great search engine today.

If you don’t like Google’s practices, the simple solution is to stop using Google or its services. Google is a big data company first and foremost. 

As the saying goes, if a service is free, you are the product.",1615880716.0,1
"But this is always just a case of selection bias. You see hundreds or thousands of ads a day, but because of ad saturation we’ve learned to ignore them. But now you’re actively looking for these things.

There is absolutely zero evidence that Google is farming audio from people en masse. If you don’t give Google access to the microphone on your iOS device, it literally cannot get access. If Apple found out that Google was somehow circumventing these restrictions Google would be removed from the App Store.",1615882276.0,-1

Or words to that affect as I don't have it with me. I just got an Apple phone and have avoided setting up Google products on that but I will occasionally hit a Youtube video. Their privacy policy comes up so I gave it a read and it's pretty clear some of your data will go to a third party but they'll not tell us who that might be and what data they're passing them. It's pretty near the end too, so they go in to lengthy detail about justifying how they'll use your data and then at the end say, ""Oh and we might give any of this data to companies we use but let's face it, we can't ever be 100% confident in how they'll use it once they have that data.""

And yeh I'm sure the response it, ""But it's not related to you. They probably strip out your data."" But how can I be SURE about that? How can I be sure that data has enough info to be able to  pinpoint me? I simply do not know what data they're giving out so am I meant to just trust them? Why am I required to just do that?

Maybe Google could help themselves by giving a demonstration of exactly the kind of data they pass around so we can all be more informed and put at ease. That is, unless there's a reason they don't want to do that.",1615885275.0,1

Yes, those are all ad backed, and ads have their own set of issues, but your assertion that one is objectively worse than the other is truly mistaken. I don't want to live in a world where only the rich have access to information and people who can't afford it fall further behind.

I also don't think that advertising itself is inherently evil. There are millions of small businesses and entrepreneurs that have things to sell and want to find an audience. For example if you make an app for Animal Crossing players and want to target it specifically to them, or you made a new tool that helps people with Parkinson's. In a word without targeted ads, only the rich big corporations can market and sell anything.

Though, worth noting, this article is about iOS. On iOS, all browsers use the WebKit rendering engine, the same one Safari uses.

Next, get rid Android and the entire non-Apple mobile industry collapses. Samsung and Huawei will probably make their own OS and every other smaller phone company will die out not being able to compete with their own proprietary OS.

Third, let's look at Youtube. In terms of normal video hosting, there may be a few alternatives, but when it comes to actually allowing creators to make a living creating videos, I don't think any other alternative exists. The majority of the creator community probably disappears. A few really large ones may be able to survive off of Patreon, but most won't.

Last, without Chromium, half of the browsers out there stop existing, though they may be able to switch to Firefox's rendering engine. Not quite familiar with how customizable/workable it is, considering everyone forks off Chromium as it's much easier to work with.

"You didn’t really say anything though. As someone that’s repaired and built these things since before they came out, literally, the repair issue is the only one iPhones really aren’t great in, and they’re still repairable, there’s just hoops that shouldn’t be. As far as usability is concerned, which is what the overwhelming majority of people are concerned with, Apple is either on par or better than everything else for a longer period of time. Optimization is light years ahead of Android. Apple gets to have their own APIs on most apps because limited hardware sets to develop for. All hardware and software design is in-house. There’s no fragmentation. Most of the customization is there, too, seeing as how most people only care about fonts and folder layouts. How many clock widgets is enough lol. The phones hold better resale value, better social status for those that care, they offer better interoperability within other like-brand devices, as good if not better interaction/UI as well as more intuitive UI,  more security,  longer lifespan, more accessory options, etc. Then we can get into preferential reason why IPhones are better. They’ve always been form and function together. The style of iPhones has steered the industry through multiple generations. From fonts and keyboards to colors and methods of production, Apple has dictated many aspects of the industry. 

Where I will agree is the actual hardware oh iPhones, specifically the charging and power delivery circuits of the iPhone 6 through the iPhone 8 weren’t great and there should have been efforts made to correct that. MacBooks and macs have similar issues REPEATEDLY through almost a decade of computers. Don’t get me started on MacBooks and to a lesser degree, Macs. The chassis bending on the iPhone 6 was another super fail by Apple. 

I have a pretty robust background in mobile electronics, having used them, repaired them on a board layer level, and being around them in various capacities beyond just having it as a consumer device to use, and I still say Apple is objectively the better choice for tablets, phones, and wearables. I used to be the Nexus guy, too. Nexus 7, Nexus 10, had the Nexus S 4G, G-Nex, Nexus 4, 5. Those were cool but Android just got boring.

"In the case of Apple (and Google) they basically have 100% of the cellphone-based internet. But this isn't the internet of 20 years ago, when it was just a toy. These days it's closer to a utility, something you need to get a job, pay your taxes, sign up for insurance, get a doctor's appointment, whatever. If Apple decides, say, that only doctors with an Apple Health contract are allowed on their platform, that's 50% of the market unavailable to doctors that don't want to sign up - so what choice would they really have? This would be clearly considered abusing their dominant position in the market, and leveraging their position to unfairly favour their product * 

So basically when a company gets large enough to be considered a monopoly (or here, part of a duopoly) then the law starts to take an interest.  Of course, it doesn't help that it's a foreign corporation that's involved, national politics always plays a part in this :)

"For a small business it’s fine but as they get bigger, there would be no way for competition to survive as they don’t have near the budget required to create an entirely new phone with it’s own OS (and maybe an app distribution service) just for their app. Now Apple has that huge budget as well as a huge user base and they block competing App Stores and force their payment systems to developers (sometimes even for free apps). That’s where the problem lies. One argument that is being put forward is that Apple may own the OS, but people who buy the phone own the phone and therefore they should be able to decide what software + hardware changes they can be able to do. I hope that argument pushes Apple to open up the browser to competing app distribution services as well as make it easier to repair and make hardware changes to the phone.",1615989398.0,1

"As someone who’s never owned an iPhone before the iPhone SE 2020 I’ve literally never experienced any of what you did on Android and I can’t help but wonder if you just bought a 20 dollar Android device from Walmart that didn’t have the hardware to run it properly at all.  You get what you pay for, the minimum I’d spend on any smartphone would be 250 bucks for a brand new one. 

Android had a better UI imo or at least the notification system was leagues ahead of iOS. Why the fuck do I have two notification systems on iOS, why are notifications so difficult to interact with? Why can’t I just reply in notification for my messaging apps? And for the love of god Apple, I don’t care that I just bought this thing, If you’d release an iPhone with a notification light so I’ll stop missing messages whenever I’m not in the room with my iPhone I’ll literally sell this thing and get a new one ASAP.

I’m in no way saying iPhone is perfect, I’ve just had better luck with it.

"Only thing I agree with you 100% is that iPad is the best tablet out there. They provide enough speed, and build quality for a good price. Now that being said 5-6 years ago my Galaxy Note Tab 10.1 was the best tablet I've ever used. That screen was just 🔥🔥🔥, I used the S-Pen for all my notes during school &amp; the battery life rocked. 2 things sucked about it, TouchWiz &amp; I only got I think 1 1/2 years of updates before support was killed off. 

Now that out of the way I still think Android phones is the way to go. The fragmentation is just more options. Don't like samsungs ui, try LGs, or Google's, or motorola. Want a phone that can become a tablet, we got that, want a phone you can add attachments to like a speaker, battery bank, etc. That's on android. Do some fail and flop? Yes, but that's the free market, you get to pick &amp; choose what you want and try new and interesting things every year. Don't like face recognition, cool we got phones still with fingerprint scanners, both on dedicated buttons or built in under the screen. Want 120hz refresh rate on the display, you got it. Want cheaper, or even more free apps that you'd have to pay for on the App store; cool the play store has got you covered. Android is constantly growing and expanding the status quo of moble tech. 

Apple used to be this way, my iPhone 4s was light-years ahead of the competition at the time, &amp; my 5s was just a class above the rest in terms of fit, finish, and use. However lately apple has been trailing behind, they say it's to perfect the tech, but in reality it's to keep the margins low and the profits high. They could've ditched the notch a while ago while integrating face id into a smaller form factor but they haven't. They could've switched to type C years ago, but they haven't. They got to have those lightning royalty checks flowing in from cable manufacturers. Touch id, everyone loves touch id and I don't blame them, they could've integrated that back into their phones with underscreen readers a while ago, but they didn't. 

The M1 is fantastic and I love the fact arm is really starting to take off in the Computing space. But I can't help but feel that Apple doesn't have some secret sauce to make it good. I think they're just the first to hope into the pool. The second AMD start to go 100% into arm I think apple with have some steamy competition. Qualcomm has been failing to deliver for years now like intel &amp; it's gonna take a kick in the pants for them to catch up. Samsungs exynos chips with Radeon graphics looks promising, &amp; I got to imagine AMD is cooking up some promising Ryzen Arm based CPUs while they work with samsung. If that happens and it comes to android I think apple won't stand a chance.",1615994199.0,1
A complex issue requiring a refined solution. I think however the simplest way is to just tax based on the percent of the device still in working order when disposed of. A cracked screen is fairly cheap but apple charges a whole phone to fix it. Writing devices off as a total lost would be easy to spot fraud. Tax money made by this method could then be used to do spot checking to see how Apple writes products for fail. Finally it is the people that pay the tax. Yes the people. We live in a consumer world and why would you buy a product that cost too much to dispose of and can't be repaired. It would be a race to make affordable repairable products. Maybe not refined idea but I think I got something to work with.,1615996367.0,-1

The ""trick"" Zoom used is available to everybody. Get a refund and Turbo Tax will ask if you want to put that money towards next year's taxes. As for executive compensation, how much of that is driven by profits and and rise in stock value? Their stock price jumped from under 100 in early 2020 to over 550 by October. Profit margin jumped from 4% to over 25%; that's Apple, Google and Microsoft territory. 

Even if you argue that those profits came from circumstances outside their control, the fact remains that they were the ones who capitalized on it. Despite having Teams at our disposal, my company has used Zoom for a couple of years now, because it performs well and has a more intuitive UX than anything else we've tried. Pricing was low enough that there was no hesitation in giving it a shot. So clearly, they made some good decisions which enabled their success.

See also: paying more for more storage in a phone (costs a few dollars extra to include more storage but the upgrade is a hundred), premium software features, graphics card tiers (these are also affected by binning, but a lot also just have areas of the chip disabled in firmware or by cutting traces on the board.*).

You could in fact extend the analysis to just about every option for cars, because options are *extremely* expensive compared to the cost to the manufacturer. Do you think it actually costs hundreds more to paint a car blue than red? I don't.

In all cases providing one single customer with the upgrade/service/whatever does not cost the company as much as the customer is willing to pay. That is a natural consequence of capitalism and is not even a particularly harmful one. The fact that Apple can perform market segmentation means that Apple can make the same profit while reducing the average cost of its products, and in a competitive market that should reduce prices. The alternative here, if BMW were to offer this at no extra cost, would likely be to **increase the base price**, not offer this for free.

\*Actually on that subject, an anecdote: the CPU I bought for my first-ever PC had a locked multiplier so couldn't be overclocked much. You had to pay more for a chip with an unlocked multiplier - an enthusiasts' version so to speak. *Or* you could, on my specific chip, physically cut the connection with a dremel that signalled to the chip to lock the multiplier. Needless to say I didn't try that. There were other tricks too depending on the nature of the limit: you could wire together two pins of some CPUs, or draw a line on the chip with conductive pen and things like this. This is before modern CPU sockets and CPUs with integrated heatspreaders.",1617030699.0,1

"&gt;No. If anything, it's a difference in opinion. Please refrain from titulating people you disagree with as 'liars'. lf you pulled that little American rhetorical stunt in Germany, you might get sued.

A lie is a lie. Maybe you don't know it's a lie, and are unwittingly regurgitating it, but it's a lie nonetheless. It's not exploitation when someone makes an offer, and another person willingly accepts the offer.

If you think it's exploitation, then don't accept what they're offering. Put away this victim narrative. It's dishonorable and exploitive.

&gt;Wow, terrific insight. I don't know what things are like on the other side of the Atlantic, but here in the German lands, indentured servitude was abolished centuries ago.

It looks you're being overly emotional and not understanding the concepts you're referencing. Indentured servitude didn't allow you to quit. With Amazon, you are free to quit.

&gt;Yes, and they're entitled to fair compensation for their service to their employer.

Legally, socialist laws can entitle them to many things that they are not morally entitled to, and this is one of them. What's 'fair compensation' is the compensation that Amazon offered, and they accepted.

They are not children - stop infantilizing them and claiming they're victims for accepting terms of employment that you find unfair.

&gt;Any good employment contract should be based upon a consensus amongst equals, not by economically stronger parties imposing their will upon economically weaker ones, because that regularly leads to exploitation. You must really naive believe otherwise (and that's me putting it nicely).

Again with you pushing this braindead socialist victimhood narrative, that does  nothing except appeal to people's emotions and reflexive envy toward, and suspicion of, the wealthy.

Any employment contract that is freely agreed to IS based upon consensus amongst equals. The economically stronger party is always equal to the economically weaker party, in its right to offer any terms it wants, and refuse to agree to anything it doesn't want.

The only power the economically stronger party has in free market contract negotiations is to offer the worker better terms than the next best option available to them. They cannot force them to accept terms that are not better than their next best option, because the worker can simply refuse those terms, and accept the better one.

Apple cannot force me to buy an iPhone, no matter how much it's worth. Amazon cannot force me to work for it, no matter how much it's worth. The only power both of these $1 trillion+ companies have is to offer me a product/service/job that is better for my interests than anything else available on the market.

So no, your victim narrative is a pure lie, promoted by those seeking to deceive the public into supporting their efforts to suppress the private property and contracting rights of others in order to exploit them.

"Android Helplines article - doesn't actually say that Apple sends less data overall, and includes the line ""Ultimately, the amount of data that trickles out of your phone in the background really shouldn't be the determining factor when you're comparing Android to iOS. ""

Statista - actually includes a study, but only talks in terms of the number of times data is sent per hour, not what the data is or how much there is of it.  Inconclusive.

PCMag article - doesn't actually say which of two is worse.

Marketwatch - Only a small part of the article is about phones ending data, which is opinion only.

I don't see how you could have formed a rounded opinion based on these articles.  Only one of the four actually says what you want to read, and that's the one with the least analysis backing that up.",1617181530.0,-1
Read the article. Apple send more data,1617181771.0,0
"&gt; You want to stay private? Don't use the internet at all. But that's impossible, you see the issue? Get rid of Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, etc. What is going to happen? More companies will fill in those voids and resume farming the same data that the old ones were.

You're missing the third option here, which is use the internet but don't use those companies. It might not be 100% possibly but it's 98% possible and for many of us that's good enough. Frankly I don't regard Apple as the same as the other companies you list because their business model is based on selling you a product rather than giving you stuff for free so they can package you up to advertisers, which in turn means I trust them a little more (or, phrased differently, I don't distrust them as much as the others).

I've almost entirely cut out Google and Facebook these days, it's not that hard. Their trackers are blocked, I use nextdns to keep an eye on how many requests my network makes to domains they own and I take action if I see a sudden spike. You can get by without the majority of their services - for me, youtube and whatsapp are the sticking points, but even then you can mitigate it (e.g. my TV is logged into a separate Google account for youtube, and my browser is configured to sandbox youtube away from the rest of my browsing activity - no shared storage, cookies, cache, or anything else). Amazon is harder to leave, especially after the last year of pandemic lockdowns, but I make sure I don't use any Amazon devices in my home and, again, I keep the browser tab sandboxed away from everything else.

Oh, and I have to use some Google services for work too, but I run a completely different browser profile for that and it's not connected to any of my personal accounts.",1617182366.0,1

Google uses cloud-based machine learning, apple uses on-device machine learning. Your device has to send a lot of data to google “for functionality” (because google wants your data), but apple doesn’t want your data and doesn’t need it for functionality.

"Also, apple is a closed 'atmosphere' so to speak. English isn't my first language, so far lack of a better word I call it atmosphere.

Anyway my point is, Android has a million different patches, updates and all different brands and technology. Apple is just 1 device with new tech every year or so.
If Android devices send 20.000 pieces of data to Google but only a 2000 pieces of that data is good enough to use for something. Meanwhile Apple sends 1000 scraps of data of which all is used, that changes the equation by a shitton.

It's like researching the correlation of one specific thing, say babies born till april 2021. You could say the increase in babies is directly correlated to the coronavirus. In this case you'd probably be correct for the most part but it still doesn't tell the whole story. Now this is a decent example, but researchers will go so far as to say, the stock market crashed in march 2020 because the amount of people going to the zoo declined in januari with the EXACT SAME proportion. This example doesn't make the slightest sense. There are always way too many moving parts for one thing / reason to cause 100% of something else moving.

Apple's business model is based on selling devices. They actively try to prevent commercial exploitation of such data and leakage to 3rd parties ... other than possibly to find out how to sell you more of their own devices.

So, in effect, data taken by Google is in the wild while data collected by Apple is hidden away. That is a huge difference in practice.",1617190063.0,1
"A company built on mining and selling data takes more data then Apple, study says.",1617191245.0,0
It is not a coincidence ofc. It's a combination of smart statistics and context awareness. Apple does not need to listen to you to come up with matching recommendations.

For example, I work at one of the hundred largest companies in the world, in an upper level analytics role. If I wanted to grab specific user information I have to write a business case for it and then it has to be approved multiple times. 

Far too many people have no idea about what companies do and just hear ""data"" after watching the Big Hack and think all data is evil.

Second, your point is a bit off topic and and therefore easily misunderstood: we are talking about the amount of data being sent and you write sth about encryption.

That's how I came to the conclusion (and the other poster before me) that you don't seem to understand what encryption does.

Only way I could see you doing that legit is if you were screen sharing with a customer while they used it. Otherwise there were no tools provided by Apple for tracking phones, at least not at the bottom tier of support. For extremely obvious reasons.

I recently started a programming job at a new company that provisions Macs for everyone. I'm someone who alternates between the trackpad and a mouse.

Another example? I needed to copy the path to my current location in Finder. On Windows, it's in the File Explorer address bar, just like how a browser has the current URL in the top. Very intuitive. On Mac, there's not even a right-click option to get the path. You have to use `Opt + Cmd + C` to copy the path, like I'm supposed to just know that off the top of my head.

Maybe Macs are easy to use if you're doing the bare minimum and using them as $2k web browsing clients.

"&gt; Hard to incentivize devs to build windows phone apps when there aren't enough users

Not really. You just attack the problem from a couple of different ways. 

First start giving Windows Phones away when people buy Windows laptops and desktop PCs. Make them the cheapest or free option for places like Verizon and AT&amp;T. Offer free phones to ""beta testers"" and Youtube personalities to play with and talk about. Microsoft should have done this from the beginning instead of trying to sell ""flagship phones"" like Google and Apple do. There is no reason why every 14 year old shouldn't have had a free Windows Phone and once that happens you'd have a generation of customers who grew up on your platform.

After that you aggressively partner with companies like Facebook and Google. Let them run *their own ads* inside of their apps. Let them keep 100% of the profits generated by their apps. *Pay them directly* for app support for your platform and offer them things they want. For instance Microsoft could have let Google be a default search partner for Cortana on mobile and desktop.

The problem is that Microsoft wanted to control everything because it is used to controlling everything. That strategy doesn't work when you're the weak newcomer in a growing market you've been late to adopt.",1617293748.0,1

"I feel like this maybe feature should maybe get a fail safe even if it's something like you can also use your phone for it, but I do get the move here. From an engineering stand point I get why you would want to make this move and continually add more to the touch screen. 

First point is a strictly mechanical engineering point and a good rule of thumb that most if not all engineers go by. Less moving parts the better, when somethings mechanical its going to   
 break eventually which causes the need for service. It's typically much easier/cheaper to fix something that's software and not physical. So because of this you now need to go to a mechanic for your car that much less.

Now the big money saver is really in industrial engineering. Every part you can remove saves on cost in parts and manufacturing time. It would help increase production which will make you more money and save on parts which will make you more money. For Tesla they've been know to bring these saving too the customer so in turn we get cheaper cars. Removing this part too can be thought of with the same mindset as the reason apple went to a touch screen over buttons for a keyboard. You can now make a more similar car for every market assuming shifters change between regions and they weren't already standard. If so this again saves them money on tooling and training.

The last point is based off a future view of Telsa and really all cars. Telsa's big goal is to build autonomous cars so the shifter won't be needed. They already have a pretty impressive self driving tech that already has the capability to shift the gears so why wouldn't they remove it and save some money.",1617295808.0,1

"&gt; Most progressives have a very sophomoric understanding of capitalism and how it actually functions in society.

So do most conservatives, or liberals, or libertarians for that matter. Most people seem to pigeonhole themselves into one specific cure-all ideology and ignore its flaws when convenient while laser-focusing on the flaws of others and ignoring their advantages.

The apparent assumption as well that the progressives are all poor and whining about not getting handouts or whatever is also incorrect - plenty of people in high paying dev jobs at these companies _are_ progressives, likewise, plenty of those on the floor at fulfilment centers are going to be conservatives who are against this.

&gt; In a capitalist framework, this means the customers experience of the products is of utmost importance

Rarely. All the hate aside, Amazon is relatively unique when it comes to major corporations and its internal cultural ethos of customer experience above all else. Do you think the companies like Apple and John-Deere currently fighting against right-to-repair legislation are honestly doing it out of the goodness of their hearts for the sake of customer satisfaction? No, of course not, they're doing it because monopolizing the maintenance of their planned-obsolescence based products in order to encourage people to upgrade every couple years or buy overly expensive full replacements instead of just fixing simple issues is far more profitable for the company than just letting people own what they paid for.

In a capitalist framework, maximizing profit is of utmost importance, nothing else. Amazon happens to think good service is an effective path to maximizing profit, and for them it was true, especially early on when ""internet shipping"" was a burgeoning new space with tons of competition, and it helped build the company's reputation and retain customers. Not all companies do that though, because not all companies _need_ to do that in order to boost profits. It would be _nice_ if that was a universal inherent incentive and everyone just did the nicest thing to make everyone happy and usher in utopian libertarianism, but they don't.

As for warehouse workers, it's possible to be profitable while also adequately paying employees, or at least it should be, and if you aren't able to then your business should be considered non-viable. Maximizing profit is all that matters, if pure capitalism had its way, the Amazon warehouses would be staffed by slaves or managed like old Foxconn plants in China. As a society though, the wellbeing of its citizens should be a priority, and that includes warehouse workers who enable you to get your knickknacks in only two days.

&gt; The market is where the political decisions happen, but that’s to hard for progressives, who just want to rage at every symptom.

That's why Apple supports old phones so long, for instance - not out of the goodness of their heart, but because every time you buy a new phone there's a chance you'll buy something other than an iPhone. And if that happens more frequently then that chance is even higher. Someone who owns an iPhone for 1 year is much more likely to switch to Android than someone who owns one for 5 years.

Genius Bar teams will make every effort to extend a repair program to you. The system automatically brings it up and you have to acknowledge that you discussed it. Repairing for free is something that makes the job a little easier when customers get excited about it. However, both the store and the individual take a hit if we use a repair program to cover an unrelated issue. When a machine gets wet, it’s extremely damaging and there’s no longer a way to be sure that a device qualifies for a program or it was simply damaged so we can’t send them off under repair programs if the liquid sensors are tripped. 

**tripping a MacBook Pro sensor**
And for some context, I licked my finger and touched the sensor, didn’t trip. I then splashed water on it, didn’t trip. I then took a dropper and put a little bead of water on it and it slid off. That’s because there’s this layer of coating on the sensor to really demonstrate that if it’s tripped, water was present for a significant amount of time and in enough quantity.

"""Slowing down batteries"" 

Know how I know you don't know what you're talking about?

Electricity moves at the speed of light.  Period.

What you have screwed up in your mind is the fact that, when batteries started losing capacity (as lithium batteries do...  all of them), they were no longer able to supply enough voltage to reliably run the phone, so you would get crashes.

In order to keep the phone working, apple slowed down the cpu so it required less power, and the phone could continue operating reliably.  Replace your battery (google it, there are literally thousands of views how to do this yourself, in under an hour) and the phone goes back to full speed.

This is literally the opposite of planned obsolescence.  This is a design to keep a phone working longer.

"Batteries are a consumable and they wear out. The feature Apple added was to use power management to extend the useful lifetime of a worn out battery. When this happens on other devices without a similar feature the device just crashes/reboots. This is the absolute correct technical solution and still in use on all apple devices unless it is actively disabled by the user. There is no valid reason for the user to disable the feature but it was added anyhow.

Apple even mentioned this feature quite plainly in the release notes when they added it. Anyone with even a tiny bit of technical understanding could have read the description and known exactly what the feature was doing.

Where Apple went wrong, in my opinion, is not doing a sufficiently good job of training their staff on this and getting the tools in front of them to know when a device was in this state and not realizing that they needed to do a broader outreach program on this and not just use release notes that evidently no one reads.

There is even a significant market of used ThinkPads. Check the links in the right margin on /r/thinkpad.

I don't want to run Microsoft Windows spyware, so I've been running Linux on my ThinkPad since the day I bought it. I had switched from Windows to Linux years earlier after my desktop  motherboard died: I expected to be able to simply swap the motherboard and be back to work with minimal downtime, but instead got the infamous Microsoft Blue Screen of Death. With Linux, I can quickly move the hard drive to a spare ThinkPad (or just about any other x86 computer) if there is a hardware failure, with a maximum downtime of 10 minutes (or 1 minute if I boot from the swappable removable drive caddy).

"I had a pixel 4xl and I switched to the iPhone 11 Pro Max. I’m not the person you asked but I’ve been wanting to have this conversation for a long time ever since switching a year ago. Ive had every nexus and every pixel until the 5. 

I actually miss android a lot, from the ability to torrent, to being able to freely side load apps, there’s a lot about android that I definitely miss. But there were definitely annoyances and I have to remind myself not to look back with rose tinted glasses. 

First, the failure of android to place the UI process above all other processes. This was a daily annoyance even on the 4xl. Clicking a text field for entry, it could take up to 5 seconds for the keyboard to come up. This was also an issue with the share menu, which I know Google claims to have “fixed” with every update to android, but it was still trash on my 4xl. 

Second, the failure of android to provide a consistent and reliable performance and battery life. I know iOS isn’t immune to hardware issues, but I’m not the only one who had to trade back my 4xl for a new one. But besides that, the battery life is pretty random on android on every phone I’ve owned. Don’t get me wrong the 4xl was pretty good most of the time, but sometimes it would be 100 to 10 percent in half a day. Why? Who knows, the battery screen on android often just shows “system processes” instead of accurately tying those processes to shitty apps. No I didn’t have Facebook installed. Which, I should be allowed to have a super popular app installed without it killing my phone. Androids battery problem is android, not because Facebook takes advantage of it. 

Third, I’m not Googles beta tester. I got so sick of Google starting and cancelling projects, releasing and killing apps, I just straight up don’t trust Google for anything anymore except search. On android I already moved away from their products, Signal for sms, Firefox browser, Bitwarden password management, everything. And as I watch the killedbygoogle.com list grow I feel better and better about that decision. And I can still use all those services on iOS. Bitwarden password fill works at the system level and is amazing. Firefox might not have gecko, but it still syncs my history and bookmarks. Etc etc. 

Fourth, this one isn’t daily annoyance, but updates. Even as a veteran android user, update day always scared me. Especially for major rollouts. Who knew if my phone was going to turn back on? Who knew if when it did turn back on that it wouldn’t be a slowed down, bogged down, stuttery mess because something went wrong with the update process? I know again that iOS isn’t immune to slow downs from updates (and there was a whole ass lawsuit about it) but that was based on newer updates on older hardware. I’m just talking about major OS updates on *current* hardware. Idk how many times in my android life (and my families) that I had to factory reset a phone due to a botched update. 

The rest of my complaints are ideological. I find Apple at the front of the curve for privacy a majority of the time. I don’t *trust* Apple, but I do recognize that safari unlike chrome has much better default privacy settings. Having physical Apple stores I can visit for hardware issues, having bomb ass customer support without paying for Google One etc.",1617378122.0,-1

"Planned obsolescence is when a product is intentionally designed to fail prematurely in order to push customers to buy a new one. It’s been illegal for decades and isn’t really done anymore by any company.

Idiots on the internet love to complain about planned obsolescence because they have no clue what it means. They that when a brand new app doesn’t run well on their 5-year-old phone must be because that evil smartphone company is trying to trick them into buying a new phone, not because the new smartphones are literally five times more powerful and the app is designed to take advantage of that. They think that when their kitchen appliance breaks after a year it’s because it was designed to break, not because they bought the cheapest one possible that uses flimsy plastic parts to achieve the low price. They think that changing technologies or aesthetic fads are planned obsolescence because their products are no longer cutting edge or cool.

None of that is planned obsolescence, planned obsolescence hardly even exists in the real world anymore. Not to mention that planned obsolescence can only theoretically work if the company is a monopoly, otherwise consumers will just abandon the product and buy one from another company. The thing is that planned obsolescence isn’t even *necessary* anymore because advancements in technology have made it possible to manufacture complex, high-tech products with extremely low-cost materials, nowadays things break not because they were designed to but because they were built to the lowest possible cost, if you want something that lasts longer then don’t cheap out on the one that’s priced too good to be true, at that point you’re basically knowingly buying a disposable product.

I’ll be fine if companies say “This is a free product. Using it means you will be tracked. Buy our paid product which is privacy friendly.” before the user starts working with the product.

However, in reality, the companies advertises the product as free and without mentioning the tracking part. When the users found out, the companies point to the fine prints in EULAs. If you believe users shouldn’t be entitled to using free software without being tracked, then companies shouldn’t be allowed to reap the spread benefits of marketing their products as “free” product without mentioning the tracking part. Forcing the companies to explictly bringing up the tracking part to the user’s attention is what Apple is doing. 

In the meantime, we haven’t even talked about how monopoly changes all those discussions. With the monopoly Facebook current holds, they can essentially force users accept tracking by not providing a non-tracking version altogether. You can’t even buy a track-free version of Facebook services even if you wanted to. Should we allow the company to force users into the essentially selling their information for a non-negotiable value (that is, the value of the product as is)?

"I left the question of whether it does hurt small business unanswered, because I don't think it matters.

Facebook has never cared about small businesses. They have actively turned down the dial on how much they show posts by companies, even if users are subscribed, and even if the user has interacted with the company regularly. My local wing place complained to me that no one sees their specials. I told them Facebook keeps making it harder for their little business to be seen in a feed unless they boost.   Facebook doesn't care about the little guys. They care about their profit.

It is debatable whether it will hurt small businesses more, and I think not. It will increase the cost per acquisition (CPAs) for some, especially those who rely on in-market segmentation. But it should also keep the playing field even, and so cost per click (CPCs) should fall. 

There are cases where businesses will miss out. For example, businesses selling longer funnel goods will probably miss out on being able to reach someone who is in market before the customer buys a competitor's product. Google's display network will have the same problem, as will anyone who tracks across sites.

I also don't think any of these businesses concerns hold a candle to the privacy concerns of tracking people across websites. It affects me less personally, because I use ad and cookie blockers like a crazy person. I know how much data exists and how easy it is to leak. Cambridge Analytica anyone? If you think it's not explicitly tied to your Facebook or Google account in their database you're dreaming.

Apple is already giving advertisers more data if they advertise an app on Apple's network.

Facebook actively screws big businesses in this manner because it brings more profits. Small businesses are collateral damage (and less affected, percentage wise).  

&gt;Facebook has never cared about small businesses.

Yup. Just like the rest of the tech corporations, Apple included.

I respectfully disagree. I think CPMs will rise overall as less data is available for their algorithm to use and normally very expensive target groups ""spill"" out into the more general population. Also, I suspect big businesses will actually spend more on advertising available only to them and not as affected by the changes (such as brand lift), which will give them an unfair advantage over small businesses competing in the same vertical.  

&gt;There are cases where businesses will miss out. For example, businesses selling longer funnel goods will probably miss out on being able to reach someone who is in market before the customer buys a competitor's product.

Yup, remarketing will be the main victim of this and I believe this will hurt small and especially new businesses more because they rely on it more. Big businesses have the budget for many more initiatives and higher volume campaigns, as well as a ton more data about users they can leverage as custom audiences.  

&gt;I also don't think any of these businesses concerns hold a candle to the privacy concerns of tracking people across websites.

"&gt; iOS apps cannot check which other apps are installed.

This is NOT true!!    Which is how it should be.  There is valid reasons.

If do not believe me.  Here is the code to check if another app is installed on an iPhone.

With Swift 3.0.

if (UIApplication.shared.canOpenURL(URL(string:""twitter://""))) {

    print(""Yes Twitter is installed"")

}

If you are on Swift 2.3 or lower then use


if (UIApplication.sharedApplication().canOpenURL(NSURL(string:""twitter://""))) {

    print(""Twitter is installed"")

}

You just replace ""twitter"" with the application you are interested in seeing if already installed.   This capability is done for valid reasons the majority of the time.   Just one example of a valid use case is when you have a number of applications that go together and you want to verify the others have been installed.  

How nefarious use is handled by the screen process with getting an app into the Apple app store.  If you are checking too many things and they really do not make sense it will get screened and have to answer questions on explaining what you are up to.

Obviously, apple is doing it to protect the iphone user, but it does have drawbacks because it limits what is possible with apps you run. Those same people would argue that you should know what your apps do exactly so that you shouldn't need apple to protect you (very much unrealistic).

I don't know what's the better approach, but I'd hardly trading capabilities of your apps for security a feature. It's a choice and not an obvious upgrade.",1617539768.0,1
"Nothing has changed.  The suit is barely underway.

Just looking at the facts of the case as they stand makes it pretty clear Apple (and Google to a lesser extent) are in violation of antitrust law.

A) People buying iPhones aren't able to install software from sources of their choosing.   This works fine for some, but restricts choice of others.

B) Apple competes on the platform *they* operate.  Let's say a video chat app better than FaceTime comes along.  Cross-platform with all the features FT has and more.   But because Apple provides FT for free, and the competitor MUST pay Apple a 30% revenue cut (since the competitor may not use anything but the App Store), the competitor is at a competitive disadvantage.

Apple, on the other hand, wins either way.

C) Apple apps play by different rules than competition is permitted to.   On iOS, Siri is the only assistant capable of full integration with the system.   You COULD download the Google assistant, but it wouldn't have a fraction the capability Siri has on iOS, giving it a competitive disadvantage.

And much more.  Epic has a compelling-enough case that [the former head of the antitrust wing of the Obama DOJ took the case.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_A._Varney)

Apple has also blankly stated that they will not allow cross platform cloud gaming services as they bypass Apple's content review (and, conveniently, the 30% Apple Tax).

"The reason I left Google and android is this. 

Google, as a business, is an advertising and information collection agency. Their sole purpose is to collect as much individual information about each and every user and sell it to whoever is willing to pay for it. 

Let me pretense this by saying I was an avid rom builder from gingerbread to ice cream. I had 9 identity compromised incidents during that time. I switched to Apple and continued to jailbreak since iPhone 8 and had a total of zero like incidents. 

I was also able to trace 6 of the incidents to pre rooted android phones and banking app data sold. 


I’m not here to say go Apple, I’m not as they have their own issues with integrity, however, my personal info has been secure via their crazy ecosystem. Google will do what it does publicly to provide a sense of protection as it always has, but if you take time and dig thru the fine print on all Google products, you agree to let them sell every single micron of data you give them access to. Apple does not. 

Again, this is a know what you agree to. I don’t have any mainstream apps on my phone, and know that Amazon, Facebook and its ownership properties, Bing,  Google and its ownership properties and any and all application companies who agree to the Google Informational Sharing Agreement have access to everything you have on your phone if it is Android. I know I’m not 100% locked down secure on Apple, and that is a reason I am continuing to research and deconstruct privacy OS for specific android phones to verify info is as secure as it can be along with what I will eventually put on a rewritten pixel 5/6

"&gt; the cable thing was a display cable inside the mac or something similar, you can find it on gis channel if you want.

Oh, I guess you mean a display flex. Those have been getting a lot of attention lately, Apples ""stage lighting"" screw up is just going through the court system right now.

Personally I wouldn't want to try to replace on of those. Flexes are notorious for receiving damage during install and then breaking again long before their rated life. But then again I have't had to deal with it so that's easy for me to say.

&gt; i'm just wondering do you think they should allow third party repairs or do you agree with apple on this, regardless of louis and his ""angle""?

They already allow third party repairs. You've seen Rossman doing them. It is your device, you can do what you want with it.

The issues that arise are whether the repair shops have the knowledge to do it, whether they can get the parts to do it, whether it is feasible to do it, and whether they are honest enough to do it.

For the first, the repair shops generally want access to schematics (and presumably a physical layout description too). They generally get the former somehow, I don't know how as Apple doesn't want them to get that info. There's not a lot of harm in schematic availability. All of my opinions on this are colored by what I will relate below so I also think it's not actually all that useful. And it'd never be universal anyway, just one of Louis' anti-Apple things. I have a TV remote in front of me, I didn't get a schematic for that. Have a PS5 controller, no schematic. I have a nice Analogue Super NT SNES compatible, they are great guys and charge a lot of money for their stuff (even on an Apple scale they do). They don't give out schematics either. And sure as heck you are not going to get accurate (useful) schematics with your cheap Chinese stuff, they go so far as to erase the numbers of the chips on their boards to keep that secret. So on this, I say pretty much whatever. I don't see a schematic law really aiming at anyone but a few choice targets.

Second is getting the parts. Small shops are not interested in buying parts from Apple at the prices Apple would charge anyway. Apple would charge a lot for the parts anyway. Small shops would immediately go back and say these batteries cost so much, why are you ripping us off? This is because small shops are generally buying knockoffs, counterfeits, and other garbage batteries. They can't realistically undercut Apple on subassembly replacement (like batteries, displays) costs if they cannot also sell you cheaper, inferior parts as part of it. I feel stores are generally doing their customers a bad service by portraying their services as the same but cheaper. What people like Rossman want to be able to do is buy counterfeit parts from China, put them in phones where people don't get a chance to see they are counterfeit because they are inside and then tell the customer they got [""real parts made in the same factory just without the logos""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb_R1VZqLcE). I am not a fan of this. I know there can be exceptions to this, but they are not the common case, despite what the repair shops want to say.

Third, whether it is feasible to do this. This really comes down to repairability. Apple charges a lot to fix stuff for a couple reasons. First is they're insane. They just don't know how to do anything cheap. Look at the original Mac Mini. It was like $400, really left off a lot of features that few people need. A few years later the thing has added SP/DIF optical audio out, etc. all kinds of cool features but that raise the price and no no uses (have you even seen the special cable needed to get optical audio out of a special 3.5mm jack? Unless you had a Sony Discman and Minidisc player you connected to each other the answer is no). When it comes to small devices like laptops and phones they not only make them too ornate to start but they are really hard to fix without destroying the cosmetics. So they replace the cosmetic parts when doing work inside. There is a person on here related that to fix his key board they had to replace the top cover (the part you rest your hands on) on his laptop and because the battery was glued to that they replace the battery too. It is possible for an independent shop to make a cheaper repair if the customer doesn't mind cosmetic flaws. Apple should make this easier. They should make it easier on themselves too. I know gluing stuff together does make devices that are moved around more reliable. Connectors do not work as well as soldering batteries in and gluing them down. But use 3M COMMAND adhesive or something, make it possible to fix one part without replacing 4. Apple should spend more effort on repairability for all our sake.

Fourth is whether they are honest enough to. And most just are not. I already spoke of how they want to use counterfeit parts above. But they also will flat out commit fraud to save them money. What do I mean? Well, when you work on a complex board replacing parts you know what the big risk is. You know the big risk is you will screw up and wreck the entire board, make it unrepairable, worse than before. I've done it a lot on my own projects. I've done it on devices I bought. When I do it to myself I curse my luck and just have to pay to replace it. A small shop has to calculate in the chances that they will wreck a board while fixing it. Add in those costs and pass them onto the customer. But that raises prices which makes it harder to compete. And even if you do raise prices, when you screw up and have to buy a new motherboard for the customer you still reduce your profits because you were just banking the extra you charged ""just in case"" before, now you have to spend it. So what do shops do? They cheat. They go find a machine that is under warranty and swap the parts into that and then take it to the retailer (Apple store) and say ""it broke, don't know what happened, fix it under warranty"".

I would love to say this is otherwise, but I just know better. My golf partner used to do this for a repair shop he worked in. The boss would have them go buy new computers, swap all the bad parts into one computer (where possible, obviously you can't put two hard drives into one machine) and then return the computers for warranty repair. Break a cable? Swap it into a warranty machine. These small shops work on small margins and when it comes down to taking a big financial hit versus committing some fraud against big companies who they see as not being hurt by it they can justify the fraud to themselves.

So what do I think? I think it's complicated. If I really felt people could fix their own stuff I might be more for it. But people are not going to come out ahead by spending $400 on tools (stereoscopes are very expensive) to fix their own stuff. But if it's for small shops then I'm a lot more skeptical because I think no matter whether Louis Rossman shows a video of him moving a resistor or not it's hard for them to really stay in business without being scammers.

I very much think that Apple should work on their repairability, it would reduce the costs of third party and Apple Store repairs.",1617549984.0,1
No they do it because it’s profitable and people have become tribal about Google and Apple products. I switched to Apple for the user experience and privacy rules.

"What a baseless opinion. ""Apple made a good decision for themselves as a company, therefore they did good.""

No, what they did was add more proprietary parts to make something perfectly functional a hassle. The audio jack was universal; universal is *great* for the consumer because anything will work. Now you, as a consumer, need extra parts for something that worked perfectly fine before. All they had to do was offer a model *with* port, but they're greedy and want to sell more useless products because they have a large portion of the market. It's a ""screw the little guy"" mentality that's toxic to consumers.

What's your opinion on wireless charging? If they completely remove the ability to charge your battery while you use the phone? Will they be ""brave and innovative"" for removing something that literally keeps the phone functional?",1617614209.0,1

The US Supreme Court has handed Google victory in a landmark case for the software industry, ruling that it did not break the law when it copied software interfaces owned by Oracle for use in its Android smartphone operating system.

The decision ends a legal battle dating back more than a decade that involved a damages claim potentially topping $9bn. The case also raised fundamental issues affecting the balance of power between established platforms and upstart competitors in the software industry.

The justices decided for Google by a majority of six to two, with conservatives Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissenting. The case was heard before Amy Coney Barrett, appointed by former President Donald Trump, joined the court.

The decision found that Google was covered by “fair use” protections in the early days of the smartphone industry when it used more than 11,000 lines of Oracle code in order to make its Android operating system compatible with the widely used Java software, which was later acquired by Oracle.

Using the pieces of Java code, known as application programming interfaces, made it easier for Java developers to adapt their existing programs to run on Android, a big advantage to Google in its smartphone rivalry with Apple.

Google sought to put itself on the side of upstart competitors in the tech industry, claiming that the freedom to copy interfaces is important for anyone trying to compete with powerful tech platforms. But Oracle and its supporters claimed the case showed how powerful companies like Google steal code and have the legal might to crush challengers.

“The Google platform just got bigger and market power greater,” Oracle said after its loss. It added that the case showed “exactly why regulatory authorities around the world and in the United States are examining Google's business practices.”",1617641832.0,1

Ultimately the story of HTC mirrors other OEMs who are at the mercy of suppliers. Apple is at the mercy of TSMC and Samsung for their iPhones, LG and Motorola in the same boat. The Chinese brand devices like OnePlus are immune because they internally source the components, similar to Samsung.

Take a look at IFixitIt's breakdown videos and guides and see just how many components come from a few companies that go into all phones worldwide. 

Samsung lucks out because they can build their own devices from components from their own fabrication and facilities, so they control the entire supply chain.

"&gt;Making a product repairable isn't just losing revenue streams, it's adding costs to support all those repair efforts with technical documentation, part availability, support staff, etc.

Most of these parts are sold and should be available to buy, the manufacturers are just hamstrung by contracts/deals with the phone company to only sell to them and not to repair shops. And most phone companies already have support staff, they are just terrible and most of the time just try to get you to replace the phone. Right to repair doesn't require any more support staff for phone companies, it just gives the option for other sources to offer support (actually probably lessening Apple's need for support staff).

Not to mention the brand value issues you get when your logo is on a lot of cheaply repaired devices. Will the average consumer say to their neighbor, ""my widget is acting up because I picked the least expensive repair shop when I broke it"", or will they skip that detail and say instead ""my BrandX widget is acting up, I'm sure never buying BrandX again!""

This might be the case, but there are also brand issues when your phone is designed to break right after the warranty ends and updates specifically hamstring the battery of your old devices (Apple actually did this).

It makes no financial or technological sense to have 10 year life-cycles. In 10 years, all technology is fairly outdated an cosumers **expect** to have the next best thing.

"So, as a guy who works at another Big Tech company, but not Facebook, let me give you a few complex issues that I think Facebook faces:

* Targeting ads based on your interests / likelihood of converting
* Tagging users based on facial recognition
* Improving search results
* Hosting videos, including streaming, encoding, etc.
* Filtering spam and illegal content
* Recommending new friends / groups
* Messaging
* VR
* Marketplace, which is a different search / conversion equation
* Doing all of the above at massive scale
* Having enough traffic you can't host on AWS or use off the shelf tech in many cases
* Having enough code that traditional version control and build systems don't scale

A lot of this involves tons of ML at its core. Ad networks have to be *fast*. Search has to be fast and relevant. Both have to take into account your interests.

Scale is a challenge. I can think of several times when I've had to work around standard library or language limitations to deliver software. Some ASM here and there, knowing language internals to avoid garbage collection or extra allocations in tight loops, etc. Sharding, weird geographical routing techniques, etc. 

Suddenly NGinx is too slow; can you build a faster one that fits our use cases by not caring about the general use case?

It's harder to find people who can do all of the above. Facebook et all want people to be interchangeable. Yes, there's a ramp up period, but you've got to be able to learn it if required.

My argument is that corporations already abuse the fact that government rarely gets hand on what happens outside their borders. So corporations abuse this fact, claiming certain operations is happening only in X country, while said operation is purely artificial, ie. Office for trademarks in Amsterdam, headquarters in Dublin, etc, that bares little resemblance to actual operation.

"&gt;I’m sorry dude but you’re not describing features of capitalism. Division of labor (your IT and Gardener example) are not principles of capitalism, they can be used in all economic principles. 

Actually this is false. In communism you cannot just be a gardener as you cannot just be an artist. The government choses your profession for you based on the needs it sees and your abilities it sees. Of course there was some choice which needed job you want to do, but you cannot do something that the state deems unnecessary or where the demand is satisfied.

  
You don't have the choice if you spend your money on a gardener or if you want to do the work yourself either.  
You won't be able to hire a gardener as all gardeners are assigned to work on state owned property.

Also my IT and gardener example is not just division of labor, it's free exchange of capital in a free market system. IT work requires a longer education but you have higher wages and thus it's a net positive for me to hire someone else to do jobs I am less qualified for and that I have to pay less for than I would earn spending that time working my own job. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Your second example is better, however again it only describes a private owner having direct control over their means of production (knife maker making his own knives, painter painting his own paintings).  

Except that under e.g. communism you can't do either of these things. In fact the knife maker would probably work in a cutlery factory making 10 cent butter knives instead since, luxury items aren't really produced in communist states and you sure as hell won't get to decide if you want to build something like that much less get the resources to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If the knife maker worked under a company, he would only get a fraction of the value he created. 

Sure, but he would have a stable income, work steady hours and basically carry zero of the risk. He would have to invest nothing to get started and would make the same money no matter if the company sold lots of knives or only a few this month. If he would put in the time and effort in the company and make a career out of it he might even end up earning more than he could ever make alone. 

Under capitalism you can own the means of production, or you can share the ownership with your employees if you want to. In fact employee owned companies are a not even that rare in capitalism.

[https://www.nceo.org/articles/employee-ownership-100](https://www.nceo.org/articles/employee-ownership-100)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Instead the majority goes to the private owner of the company who owns your means of production. This leads to consolidated wealth and the cycle repeats.

What is stopping the knife maker from hiring people helping him making more knives? (Nothing the guy isn't working alone, he has a few employees). What is stopping the employees of creating their own company? Again nothing.

It's literally what I did, I used to work as a programmer in a company and now I co-own my own (small) IT company. I can tell you I worked less and slept better when I was working 9 to 5 without a worry in my life. But owning your own business obviously has benefits as well.

There are many records of Adobe, Apple, Google, and other tech companies repressing wages thru collusion.  You say ""some of the best salaries"" which is overly broad. In terms of occupations, software engineering does not crack top 25 (https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/top-highest-paying-jobs/). Within the software engineering field even, you can make higher ""salaries"" as a quant or algorithmic trader in finance than in FAANG.

Software engineers also do not get ""ridiculous benefits"". Investment banking associates get paid meals, rides from and to office. Consultants get per diems which lets them spend $50+ on meals. Meanwhile software engineering benefits really have not changed in the last 20 years for these big companies. You have ""unlimited vacation"" but you are competing with your peers for promotions and not taking vacation is often seen as sign of hard work. Other than that what benefits are ridiculous? 401K? Health insurance? Standing desk? Everything is based around keeping you in the office.

Even within software engineering, the best benefits are not FAANG, they are newer companies flush with cash that are fighting FAANG by having to come up with new benefits to be more competitive. And the pandemic has given opportunity to FAANG to reduce benefits. What a coincidence that food per diems and all the talk of keeping our employees fed and healthy stopped the minute offices were closed (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/06/google-tells-employees-not-to-expense-food-perks-in-work-from-home.html).

"Apple was losing market share to Google's Android a lot faster than anticipated.  They essentially locked iPhone users phone numbers to iMessage and also prevented iPhone users from sending/receiving texts to anyone NOT on iMessage.  It was an ""error"" that they took their time fixing.  IIRC, it lasted about a year, maybe two.  Don't quote me on that, it was long ago.  Anyhow, the solution was to create a way for iPhone users to opt-out of iMessage which allowed SMS protocols to function as normal.  Here's the kicker- SMS protocols are built into iPhones natively.  Apple's software was built to intentionally prohibit access to SMS in lieu of their encrypted iMessage system.  That had to intentionally be done and couldn't have possibly been a mistake.

"By Yimou Lee, Ben Blanchard





TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) said on Thursday it is doing all it can to increase productivity and alleviate a worldwide chip shortage, but that tight supplies will likely continue into next year.

The world’s biggest contract chipmaker said it is expanding capacity and working to keep pricing reasonable.

“We have acquired land and equipment, and started the construction of new facilities. We are hiring thousands of employees and expanding our capacity at multiple sites,” Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei told an online earnings briefing.

The chip shortage is going to take “a couple of years” to abate, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told the Washington Post on Wednesday.

TSMC’s comments come after the firm reported a 19.4% rise in first-quarter profit, beating market expectations, on strong chip demand amid a global shift to home working.

TSMC, whose clients include Apple Inc and Qualcomm Inc, had already flagged “multiple years of growth opportunities” as the COVID-19 pandemic fuelled demand for advanced chips to power devices such as smartphones and laptops.

Its business was boosted by the chip shortage that initially forced automakers to cut production, but is now also hurting manufacturers of smartphones, laptops and even appliances.

On Thursday, TSMC said it expects the chip shortage for its auto clients to be greatly reduced from the next quarter.

TSMC’s net profit for January-March hit T$139.7 billion ($4.93 billion), versus the T$134.01 billion average of 22 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.

Revenue rose 25.4% to a record $12.92 billion, in line with the company’s earlier estimated range of $12.7 billion to $13 billion.

The firm forecast second-quarter revenue would be in a range of $12.9 billion to $13.2 billion, compared with $10.38 billion in the same period a year earlier. It also lifted its revenue growth forecast for 2021 to about 20%, versus an earlier forecast of a mid-teens percentage.

TSMC said this month it plans to invest $100 billion over the next three years to increase capacity at its plants, days after Intel Corp announced a $20 billion plan to expand its advanced chip making capacity.
Wei said the massive investment plan was driven by “stronger engagement with more customers” on the company’s most advanced 5 nanometer node technology as well as its upcoming 3 nanometer node, which is scheduled to enter trial production later this year.

The company also increased capital spending on the production and development of advanced chips to about $30 billion this year, up from a range of $25 billion to $28 billion it forecast in January.

Wei said TSMC is seeing its clients preparing for “a higher level of inventory” to ensure supply stability due to uncertainties from geopolitics and the pandemic. As a result, he said, the company’s capacity will remain “tight” throughout the year.

Analysts are bullish about the company’s massive expansion plan, expecting global demand for advanced chips to surge as fifth-generation telecommunications (5G) technology and artificial intelligence applications are adopted more widely.

TSMC shares have risen about 16% so far this year and have more than doubled over the past one year, giving TSMC a market value of $558 billion, more than twice that of Intel’s and higher than that of South Korean technology giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.

The stock rose 1.14% on Thursday, compared with 1.25% for the benchmark index.

"&gt;They didn't make the job possible or create a job, or what have you. The work already needed to be done.

Not necessarily, did the work to create snapchat exist before someone dreamed to snapchat? Or even say a blender? The light bulb?

Yeah sure it's really simple when it's unskilled labor supporting some other industry. You can say, yeah the work was there. However, in many industries there's heavy investment in R&amp;D, making new work.

You could socially fund people to go out and research new ideas and try to come up with new inventions. This can be really successful when targeted -- lots of things came out of NASA. However, it's a harder problem when it's something society isn't asking for, and doesn't know that it wants yet.

Like how does the iPhone get made in the system you're envisioning? Who dreams that up, assembles a team, and designs it, builds it, etc.

&gt;Established capitalists do not truly take on risk in the way that the average worker under a capitalist system does.

This is true, but there are plenty of owners that do start that way. I've personally worked for 2 of them.

&gt;However, now we're just relying on the morality of this group of new owners. Now they are the owner class with employees working under them with the same type problems that the owners had at their original company. It's an issue with the core system.

You're always going to have a person in charge somewhere, and you're going to be relying on their morality. 

&gt;Capitalism relies on labor exploitation, literally. The only way for the owner class to actually make any money in this way is to pay the workers less than the value that they actually produced.

Most owners don't do nothing, particularly the smaller the business. Just because the owner isn't on the floor, doesn't mean they're not doing something valuable, like say, acquiring new customers, running payroll, steering the long term direction of the company, etc.

I'll point to Steve Jobs, terrible technologist, that was all Woz. However Jobs was an excellence businessman, and without him Apple wouldn't have become what it is. He wasn't directly contributing to manufacturing, software development, or R&amp;D though.

Take the value of an iPhone too... Who produced the value? The investors that paid for it initially, the idea guy, the software engineers, the computer engineers, the logisticians, or the assembly line workers?

Like... I guess what I'm trying to get at is, this isn't ""labor exploitation"", value is kind of arbitrary. I mean really, humans invented the concept of value. Owners tend to assign the least value they can to everything that creates the product, and as much value as they can to the product. It's a balance of supply and demand, ultimately. 

Again, the major issues is the labor market sucks for most people right now. Monopolies and duopolies have limited the ability for new players to enter the market, which has created a surplus of workers, and a shortage of work, which works in the favor of everyone at the top.

I know you see the world you're describing as utopian, but I see it as quite dystopian. There would be in effect one boss, the government. You don't like your boss, too bad, you can try and vote to make your boss better, but they've convinced a bunch of your coworkers they're already getting the best deal possible.

You can compare that to moderate reforms like medicare for all. They're similar, however, the insurance industry is a fraud anyways. They're betting you won't get sick, you're betting you will, and they're jacking up prices behind the scenes so you really do have to have them or you go bankrupt paying a price with an absurd markup. Socialized insurance is ultimately just a form of price regulation. You pay a tax to subsidize everyone's expenses, and the government stops companies from exploiting your health condition.

Socializing labor on the other hand, ends you up in this situation where you lose ownership of your labor. You can't form a company with a friend and start providing a service, that company becomes a government controlled asset.

People still want to be able to start companies, and own those companies. People just want to be able to do that in an environment where it's more than a fantasy, and that's where we've failed. Starting a company and being able to take business from a mega corporation is absurdly difficult right now, they will eat you in tons of ways the should be illegal. Make those ways illegal, simplify starting a company (hint medicare for all helps this too), and wages will go up, because labor demand and competition will go up.",1618500419.0,1

"This is sad news.  I worked at Adobe for six years. I got that job because of PDF

In the early 90’s, I worked for Sony as a tip writer for the CS team— we got beta versions of the games, played through them, and wrote strategy guides for the 900 line phone reps—merging word docs and screen shots (edited in PS) into Quark docs, then printed out  copies so that when you got stuck in Beyond the Beyond in the cave with the dragon, you could call the 900 number and the rep had a stack of these “tips” at their desk, and could walk you through it. 
I thought everyone would be much better served if we could build an internal website, but the tip team was loathe to learn yet another step of html editing, and WYSIWYG editors for html  were not yet a reality.  
Software junkie that I was, I was playing around with a trial version of Adobe Acrobat, and discovered the linking within a document worked much like the links in a website—and the PDF printing engine was as good as printing a Quark document on paper— better even, because it was in color, and saved us time from writing footnotes telling people to go to page xx if they held the blue chalice, and to page x if  they hadn’t yet spoke to the dragon. It also would save  our department thousands of dollars in paper and printer costs, so my lead and I created the first set of PDF tips, and pitched it to our team, then to the director.  
We advanced as PDF advanced, adding audio and video segments, then eventually creating a library of PDF’s that were linked to a main document and were centralized on a throw away machine so that updates were instantaneous. 
After leaving Sony, I showed a friend of a friend (who worked in QA at Adobe) a version of our “e-tips” site, along with some initial trials and pain points of adding Flash 2.0 to it,  and his jaw dropped open, and he said “ You have got to come work at Adobe.” So I entered the world of Software QA quite easily, since I was already doing it for free, submitting bugs to both Adobe and Flash as part of the beta programs. 
So thank you, Chuck.  PDF allowed me to revolutionize a painful process at Sony as a writer, and my interest in it turned into a career in software QA 21 years ago this month, first at  Adobe and then at Apple.  Because of the PDF, I only owe $80k on my home, have been on sabbatical for the past 3 years, own more guitars and skates than I can count, and am considering opening my own business this year, while continuing on with my main passion—music. Thank you very much, indeed, and Rest In Peace.",1618726979.0,1
"No problem.

Something that got it trending hard on Twitter was people saying that that fictional cancellation fee morally justified pirating it, so lots of people jumped on that train because they like to tell themselves that they’re Henry David Thoreau for torrenting stuff.

If someone wants to pirate something then eh whatever I don’t care but it’s weird that people want a pat on the back for it.

I own or subscribe to all the major stuff (Adobe, Avid, Ableton, Microsoft, Google Suite, all the premium Spotify/Youtube/AppleMusic) except not Autodesk because I don’t need those ones enough to pay for it compared to free/libre... Adobe are really quite good at the soft sales side of things, free goodies, free face-to-face FAQ stuff at industry events.

I find them to be way more friendly to the consumer than Google or Microsoft or Apple, not as good as Ableton, and Avid I’m pretty neutral about.

Lots of people say that there’s no updates from year to year so you’re just paying for the same thing but I think that any pro user knows that that isn’t true at all. I even have an outright CS5 licence so I could just use that instead of the subscription but there’s new features added each year and every so often one feature will save me like a week of work a year in increased efficiency.

For some people they don’t need all the bells and whistles but you can buy lite versions of Photoshop and Premiere outright for $100 or both for $150.

If you need to edit video and you don’t need the whole shebang of Adobe/Avid/FinalCutPro then the best play is just to get the free version of DaVinci Resolve. It’s the industry standard software for colouration and they’ve fleshed it out for use as an end-to-end editing program.

There’s loads of free/libre alternatives to Photoshop that would be fine for a lot of people anyway but are harder to use and don’t have as many tutorials and whatnot.

As with anything it’s just a tool so you choose the best one for your task and budget.

For someone making a grocery list or calculating their taxes then Google Sheets will get the job done for free but for a professional financial analyst you need Excel, it’s the same sort of situation.",1618730788.0,1

If you are patient when you buy and sell you can usually buy for a bit below market price and sell for a bit above so I break even unless I decide I want a radical upgrade like going from 13"" to 16"".  The main differentiator is the recall and quality programs.  I keep a close eye on all of them for mac, not iPhones as the margins on second hand isn't there.  When a quality program is announced I immediately scour the Craigslist's of the the world and scoop up machines that match and then bring them to the apple store for repairs and upgrades and then resell the refurbished unit for a tidy profit.

The 2010 white plastic macbook helped me bootstrap my company in 2013 because of a recall.  I must have bough 50 of them over the course of a year.  I got lucky and scooped up a fleet from a school for cheap.  They were cheap because the bezels and hinges would cracked the weird leather bottom would fall off.  I would bring them to apple and have them refurbish them free of charge and then resell them at $150 profit pre unit on average because they looked pristine.

Another good recall was in 2013 on the 2011 27"" imacs.  The video card would fail and there was a recall.  I would buy them from companies who had several failed units and didn't bother to inform themselves so I could get them refurbished and make $300 to $600 profit on each.  The best was in 2016 when they ran out of batteries for the 2012 macbook pro 15"".  I learned that if you brought one in and paid $250 to replace the battery you would get a call from support a few days later offering a free 2016 macbook pro because they couldn't supply the request.  I bought 6 and sold 5 for $20000 and kept the other.  The other thing I do is register every mac I buy to my company but never unregister when I sell em.  Most people don't bother to register their macs so according to my apple corporate customer account I own about 100 macs, as such I get really great service.  Covid has also been an opportunity as they shut down service for a while which was very beneficial for free upgrades.  The great part is I don't do anything outside of apple's policy and if I don't do it then it is a net loss for customers.",1618780044.0,1

I could see in the tracking that it had been delivered to them. I called Apple and explained the situation and also explained that serial number to that watch was no longer registered to me. Apple actually credited me the original quoted amount against the new S5. I’m glad Apple worked with me and did the right thing. I should have sold it on eBay originally because I would still have received a lot more for it but at the moment it was convenient. Never again. I’ve never had an issue selling on eBay.

Got a quote for $740 on Apple’s site (all of the Apple stores in California were shut due to COVID otherwise I would have traded it in in the store). Got a revised quote for $260 from “white spots”. Spent a bunch of time on the phone with Phobio, they sent me photos which weren’t of my laptop... they did return my laptop undamaged (I’d heard of people getting their laptops back in worse shape). Ended up selling it to a friend who just needed it to work in clamshell for a project (so my conscience didn’t feel bad about the keyboard).

"&gt; The bold claim in the first paragraph of their website is that the car already possess all the hardware necessary for full self driving, and all that is necessary is software updates to enable it. There is no room for interpretation. That is what it plainly says.

Yeah, that it does plainly say. It's very plain, like, zero inference into what you're claiming.

&gt;That is the bold claim. That remains to be seen. Tesla may, in fact, be able to do that. Or it may be complete bullshit. Regardless, that's the first thing they tell you, so that's what they want you to believe.

If it's so plainly stated, how are you inferring a belief?

&gt;Indeed, if you read further documentation about the car, you will learn that the car is not capable of full self driving today, and the driver must pay attention.

Okay?

&gt;But that is said later, after Tesla has already told you the hardware is there, and is capable.

They never said it's capable without supervision. You're assuming that incorrectly. That's the inference you keep alluding too, which they do not say.

&gt; In my opinion they are intentionally trying to make people overconfident in the abilities of their ""autopilot"" technology.

Maybe, but I don't see that. I don't see any where they claim that the car can be operated without someone in the drivers seat. 

&gt; If they made a serious effort to force drivers to pay attention while using autopilot,

A serious effort? How is their whole enterprise not a serious effort? I'm not sure if you think they're half-assing it, or what, but there is nothing simple about it and I don't see them taking this lightly. I don't see evidence of that, except for your own specific inferences.

&gt;and not allow the cars to operate otherwise, they would surely succeed. 

To what degree? Nothing is tamper proof. Smart people will bypass. Just look at Apple vs the FBI. It's not as trivial as you make it out to be. In the crash from OP, the people in the car were highly educated, and clearly understood what they did. They circumvented safety and died as a result. This is not Tesla's fault. 

&gt;But they won't do that because it would interfere with this overconfidence in their technology that they are trying to build.

The overconfidence you accuse them of, but cannot show any example of, other than your own biased interpretation? 

&gt;Does Tesla really care about the youtubers sitting in the back seat while their cars drive around? No, or they would put a stop to it.

Again, more biased irrational reasoning. You don't know anything about what they care about, nor their actions taken to prevent abuse and misuse. Hell, the evidence is heavily in their favor with existing safety's and safeguards which stand as an example, and provable, demonstration as an antagonist to your opinion.",1618843883.0,-1

Second even if very miraculously they allow and support it, It will cost too much for them.

I have lived in Iran for 17 years and know how things are...recently the government even increased the prices for net and dropped the quality of any kind of internet. In my time living there, the highest speed I got to see was 4MB/s and that was for a company with a lot of people so it doesn't count. now that they have dropped the quality and speed the video calls I do to talk to my family in Iran get worse and worse.

The exchange rates in websites for USD IRR are wrong and it should be approximately 6 times the specified in these websites. right now every dollar is 250 000 rials or 25 000 tomans. not mentioning that it went to even 7 times(300 000rials or 30 000tomans). what that means is that for example, the price of a new apple phone is higher than some cars in Iran. Additionally right now because of Iran's poor governing a lot of people can't even afford food like meat, chicken some vegetables and etc. 

One of the things that makes me even more furious is that at the beginning of the pandemic they denied it and now the health minister said we cannot control the pandemic and now they even are using the army to force them to stay inside in some cases.

Right now people of Iran have much bigger problems than the Internet.

price of a monthly subscription 10GB data plan for a mobile provider(only net): 300 000rials or 30 000toman (without tax, it supposed to be 5MB/s but it can't load Instagram videos and it pauses several times) speed cap

price of a subscription 400GB data plan for an ADSL provider for 6 months with both data and speed cap(8MB/s) for 3 000 000 rials or 300 000toman¤¤¤¤¤you can only download and upload a sum of 400 GB in six months

There are also times where the government decreases the speed drastically to slow the communications. and comparing the prices 500dollar price with 100 dollars a month fee it will be 125 000 000 rials to but Starlink and with a 25 000 000 rials monthly fee(for toman take the last digit)",1618949070.0,-1

4.  It is in no way an important part of the process. It is pomp and circumstance that wastes time and money. For the entirety of its existence it has been a rubber stamp and the only thing it can reasonably do in an election is question a forged submission of the delegates. Interestingly a few Dems in the house objected to Trumps certification. I would bet until 2021 you had never watched a single certification in your life because like I said its pure bureaucracy. Ya know what happens if they stop the process... it happens another day (or later that day in this case). There is no situation where any of those protesters could have done a single thing to stop Biden's election.

"&gt; Have you tried adding a packet sniffer and seeing if there's traffic when you do click on them? 

SNIFF WHAT? MY TV IS NOT ON THE INTERNET!

&gt; Not all of them they don't. Who's being thick again?

I don't care if they don't all do that. It is common. It has happened to the last TVs I owned and they aren't even from the same company. You being thick about this is not fixing it.

&gt; Not to be redundant, but piholes can work around some of these situations as well.

You failed at not being redundant.

Yes, if there was a crowdsourced concerted effort to work around the ad block detection quickly then it would fix this. But you cannot count on that. Not every problem is everyone's problem. So that leaves it to me to work my butt off to find workarounds.

And I mentioned both of these things already.

&gt; As opposed to complaining about it to some random dude on the internet? Yeah, I would think that at least trying to fix it on your own might yield better results than that.

I don't want to fix it on my own! I want an actual fix, not one which makes me trade my time hacking stuff to avoid seeing ads. My time is not free.

&gt; Again, if enough people install adblockers then there will be no incentive for companies to put ads on their platforms. 

Or to work around the adblockers. Which is what they do. The companies do not have another viable way to make money. They are not just going to give up on the revenue. If I saw evidence of companies giving up on ads and going to subscription then I might feel that adblocking is really making a difference to the sites.

But I don't see that. Yes, a few sites offer ad-free subscriptions. But heck, there are more like the nytimes that charge me money and STILL show me ads.

I don't doubt that for certain services there really is a small volunteer army that continually fights the ad blocker versus ad-blocker blocker war. But this is not a broad solution.

How the heck did you get from my statement that Google and Apple are not going to stop apps on their stores from using dark patterns because they use them themselves to accusing me of just not piholing hard enough?

How is a pihole going to keep these apps from engaging in this?

"Apple and/or Google could murder the robocall industry. So dead there wouldn't be a body left to bury.

They are the only companies with the ability to do this. It would be cheap (the cost of developing an app for each platform to some minimum level of sufficiency). The app needs to be ""built-in"", third party developers can't hook deeply enough into the operating systems.

This app would be your own personal robot. You'd spend 5-15 minutes setting it up (depending on how much you hated robocallers). It would answer the phone for you, and stay on the call. As long as fucking possible (though probably even just a minute, if *everyone* were doing it, would fuck up the economics of robocalling). It wouldn't be immediately obvious that it was a robot, it'd use your recorded voice.

"&gt; In return for five years of exclusivity, roughly 10 percent of iPhone sales in AT&amp;T stores, and a thin slice of Apple's iTunes revenue, AT&amp;T had granted Jobs unprecedented power. He had cajoled AT&amp;T into spending millions of dollars and thousands of man-hours to create a new feature, so-called visual voicemail, and to reinvent the time-consuming in-store sign-up process. He'd also wrangled a unique revenue-sharing arrangement, garnering roughly $10 a month from every iPhone customer's AT&amp;T bill. On top of all that, Apple retained complete control over the design, manufacturing, and marketing of the iPhone.

&gt; U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, the top Senate Democrat on antitrust issues, said Apple&amp;#039;s announcement that it would introduce the AirTag tracker device was &amp;quot;Timely&amp;quot; as it was the kind of conduct that her panel planned to discuss at a hearing on Wednesday.

&gt; Apple&amp;#039;s chief compliance officer, Kyle Andeer, will testify at the hearing as well as Kirsten Daru, general counsel for Tile.&amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s timely given that this is the type of conduct that we&amp;#039;ll be talking about at the hearing,&amp;quot; Klobuchar said, adding that criticisms of Apple and Google&amp;#039;s app stores had not received the scrutiny that they deserved.

&gt; Apple said its AirTags were an outgrowth of its &amp;quot;FindMy&amp;quot; app, which is used for locating lost Apple devices and to share user locations and was introduced in 2010, before Tile&amp;#039;s founding.

Big difference.

Facebook already has tons of user data because you mostly contribute the content yourself in their platform.

Apple's primary change breaks the connection between ad tracking and conversion revenue. This devalues Facebook for iOS users.

This increases Apple and Google's control over ads. Apple for their own stores and search and Google for their platforms and because they have a huge deal with Apple to provide search.

If anything this decreases privacy. Google and Apple are using their leverage control to push more budgets into their ad platforms and away from competitors forcing competitors to come up with alternative tracking solutions.

"You're still approaching this as a technical matter.

As a forensic investigator, you now have a number of additional steps you need to go through in order to extract evidence. This slows you down and reduces your case rate. There are myriad outcomes from that, all of which require additional effort, be it process, technical, or both

As a prosecutor, you now need to allow for the defence to raise this - even if you have developed a set of processes so you're comfortable with the evidence, you still need to prepare your case to be able to respond with suitable testimony, etc.

If you're in charge of purchasing equipment for your forensic operations, are you going to use Cellebrite, who have now been quite handily exposed and have even the merest *whiff* of uncertainty around the admissibility of their findings...or are you going to purchase from Competitor, who doesn't have any of those problems?

You buy from Competitor. Your forensics labs are happy. Your prosecutors are happy.

You're right, the technical arms race is under way, and it probably can be mitigated. We don't know how easy or reliable that will be, but any mitigation is going to incur on *someone* an undetermined amount of money and opportunity cost

But given the usage of *very* outdated modules, *and* the (probably) unlicensed usage of Apple code, *and* the description of no implementation of best practice, *and* the need for Cellebrite to comply with whatever regulatory requirements exist around making changes to their code, they have a significant *business* problem to tackle on top of the purely technical one.",1619098376.0,1

"It's called digital tenancy. Biggest reason is the misunderstanding of ""ownership"". When you purchase something from Apple (or any other online item) you are not purchasing the item, you are purchasing the rights to use the item within the Terms of Service for the various services. There is no ""ownership"" to have. This has led to the subscription model for software (adobe suite, for example) where you don't own the software, you buy the right to use the software while you have a valid subscription.

The issue of ""ownership"" has been brought up a lot, especially every time one of these stores pops up. This isn't the first time this happened, and every single time these lawsuits come up the companies just get even better at tailoring and locking down their business model.

In the end, I would bet Apple is pretty much indifferent to access to the various products that were paid for -- but the rules are set by the ""makers"". If Apple wants to sell movies they have to do what the studios want. Same with music. That's just how things go.

For sure - although every time Cellebrite get their hands on one they'll be able to patch it out. That's why Signal are dripfeeding these files out slowly, so that the damage to Cellebrite is dragged out over the longest possible period and trust/confidence in them is eroded.

It’s a helpful, but flawed one.  Your luggage stays in Apple’s hotel permanently.  Apple agrees to house it because it’s part of the deal for you buying it.  

You actually *don’t* have the ability to move your luggage.  It literally *has* to stay in Apple’s hotel.  That’s Apple’s sales pitch: ‘come spend money on our hotel.  You can’t transfer most of the stuff you buy here, out of the hotel.  But we’ll keep it safe for you.  All you need is a unique id and you can come back at any time to enjoy what you’ve bought.  

But now, Apple basically kept your luggage that you bought from them (with the you could come back to use it any time), and they terminated your keycard access.  You can’t get in to access all the non-transferable stuff you paid for.  

You never had the ability to remove it in the first place.  So this isn’t really “oops my mistake.  I messed up and forgot my luggage.”  To me, this reads like: I checked my skis at the ski check.  Later, I handed them the unique ticket that certifies that I’m the proper owner of the skis.  And the ski check company went “yeah, this is the right ticket but it’s useless and you’ll never be able to get your skis back.”

Edit: notably, the dude could’ve broken any part of Apple’s user agreement.  And then they’d have cause for terminating the account.  

I just want to clarify that I’m not saying this dude is blameless and Apple is the big corporate bad guy.  They may be.  But this dude may very well be getting that he deserves.",1619107275.0,1

"&gt; You actually don’t have the ability to move your luggage.

Not necessarily. Some software might be available on other platforms too. Your account with some online game might be transferable.

It could be argued Apple is just a *marketplace* - and not the person you have a contract over an item or license with, they just manufactured the contact.

So if you own a 'license on some software company' through Apple - is it on Apple to terminate that license?

And regarding the Apple user agreement - just because a company wrote a piece of paper doesn't mean that they have a legal basis.

For instance in Germany a clause that Apple could *terminate your license with a third party* because you used *their marketplace* to buy that license would obviously be an unexpected clause to detriment of the opposing side (the side *not writing the TOS!) and thus would be null and void.",1619107905.0,1
"This is my worst fear when it comes to webmail accounts. If I use iCloud/Google/Microsoft/yahoo (shudder) and they cancel my account, not only do I lose all email, pictures and other cloud services associated with that account but I additionally lose access to most all of my other accounts online that require email for two factor or updates to the account. Additionally I can’t even imagine the implications of using Apple or Googles SSO for these online accounts. I imagine that data is just lost because you don’t even have a login and password. 

Someday this will all come crashing down in one way or another then hopefully we’ll come up with a better solution than free email and cloud services. 

For instance, Apple cancels my ID. I can’t login to my phone to pay my car payment through the app that has my creds stored on a recognized device. If that bank is tied to my Apple ID when I go to a new way of accessing the app it will send an email to my icloud address, or a text to my phone I can no longer use. So I’d have to get a new phone that uses another operating system and either get the code or call the bank and convince them that I no longer have a digital identity and really need to setup a new email without verification but I’m totally not trying to take over the account fraudulently.

"No one would be asking the court to rule on whether the police can use tools like Cellebrite. But software used by the police has to be licensed properly. For instance, if the police were using pirated versions of Windows then Microsoft could sue them. 

The threat here is that police departments could be sued directly by Apple for using the software. This legal risk means that the legal and compliance people in those police departments might think twice before buying - hurting Cellebrite's bottom line. In reality, Apple are unlikely to care enough about some freely available iTunes DLLs to publicly sue police departments.

But Apple absolutely might care about a company profiting from the illegal distribution of Apple software in order to compromise the security of Apple devices. So Apple could sue Cellebrite directly, forcing them to stop illegal distribution of the iTunes libraries (which would potentially prevent Cellebrite from accessing Apple devices). If they didn't care enough to do so before Signal raised awareness, they almost have to care now, because if they're seen to do nothing then other companies might decide to distribute Apple software illegally.

"Authorities in Taiwan say they are looking into a ransomware cyber-attack on a major technology firm there.

Quanta Computer is a manufacturer of many flagship Apple products, including its MacBook line.

The hackers, known as Revil, have published stolen blueprints for unreleased products, and are threatening to release more.

Taiwanese officials said they are ""taking an initial step to look into and understand"" the incident.

It is being handled by the Ministry of Justice's investigation bureau.

On their darknet website, the anonymous hackers are attempting to extort a ransom from Apple directly, writing: ""We recommended that Apple buy back available data by 1 May.""

It is understood they are asking for tens of millions of pounds.

How close the alleged blueprints will be to any actual future products is not clear. Bloomberg reports that the leaked materials include the schematics for a future MacBook laptop. The Guardian reports that a new Apple Watch is also among them.

Apple has not responded, but Quanta confirmed a cyber-attack had taken place.

In a press release, the company said: ""Quanta Computer's information security team has worked with external IT experts in response to cyber-attacks on a small number of Quanta servers.

""We've reported to, and kept seamless communications with, the relevant law enforcement and data protection authorities concerning recent abnormal activities observed. There's no material impact on the company's business operation.""

The release of the hacked material came just hours before Apple's major product showcase event on Tuesday.

Revil said the timing was not a coincidence, writing that the data leak was ""in order not to wait for the upcoming Apple presentations"".

The Taiwanese Investigation Bureau, under the Ministry of Justice, told Nikkei Asia: ""We are aware of an alleged cyber-attack involving Quanta and we are taking an initial step to look into and understand the nature of the incident.

""But we have not yet opened a case and launched an official probe.""

"Yes, I am approaching from a technical manner but also from a common sense manner.

Imagine this.

You are a customer and see this post. You contact cellebrite and ask them about this.  Their response will likely be ""we are always updating the software against known exploits"".  They may have even patched this already.

Remember the CEO was very unhappy about stories stating cellebrite hacked signal and could read your messages. This could be seen as a marketing ploy to show signal will even protect you from cellebrite.

We have zero proof that anything the CEO is saying it's legit. We don't even know what version he was using, how old the version was, and even how he got it. You could easily argue it was a compromised version.

Nobody knows if apple gave them rights. We also don't even know if the setup process has you install iTunes so they could use the libraries.

Even more doubt is that they never showed the device and did a screen record instead.

This is definitely a PR problem just like what signal had. I imagine this will not result in anything unless a phone being scanned actually visibly compromises the software.

Again we are taking the word of a CEO and it's very possible cellebrite is doing things badly. It could even be argued that signal is looking to increase customers and donations. More importantly, being open source you can verify where the files from and even review the contents.

Now they could not follow the open source model and hide this by not updating the repos again for a year:

https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/06/it-looks-like-signal-isnt-as-open-source-as-you-thought-it-was-anymore/

A good prosecutor will simply point to the source code of signal and show they are good. Of course, they could not update the source code and effectively become closed source. However now you are creating doubt about the CEO's intentions like what happened last time.

&gt; The Taiwanese company that was hacked, Quanta, makes a range of computer products, including the Mac Pro.The hackers, who posted the extortion letter and three sample technical files to their blog on the dark web, are among more than a dozen prolific cybercrime organizations that in recent years have steadily hacked targets around the world, encrypting victims&amp;#039; files or threatening to publish them and demanding ransom, usually in bitcoins.

&gt; While U.S. law enforcement agencies closely track the hackers behind the ransomware gangs, the organizations tend to operate in countries that don&amp;#039;t extradite to the U.S., particularly Russia, law enforcement agents say, making it essentially impossible to physically stop them unless the hackers travel internationally.

Realistically speaking, you’re not gonna get in legal trouble.

But if, for whatever reason, you don’t want to break DMCA, you likely are in this instance.

This is assuming you live somewhere where DMCA applies. Lots of countries have similar laws, but there’s lots of local nuance.

"This feels like when Apple went back to the days of POWER architecture and the AIM alliance.

Honestly, since the user base for Apple computers is mostly uniform, with artists consisting of most of their ""power users"", they can design something for that niche and it will serve everyone's needs under that.

I get what the article is trying to say with the whole uniform nomenclature, but there are different M1 specs. If AMD was favored by OEMs, it would be an Oprah ""You get a Ryzen, You get a Ryzen, everyone gets a Ryzen!!!"" Except there are different variations of Ryzens with different core combination. This is because X86 fabs use binning (and chiplets in the case of AMD) to make their lineups.
On the other end, it looks like the Apple line will be much more flat in terms of specs, so either they're really confident their die always comes out perfect, or they're not planning on marketing the odd one that comes out with all cores intact as a premium product.",1619187510.0,1

"That's kinda the point of the whole thing. An important part of digital forensics involves the ability to demonstrate data integrity. Images are made of the device which are considered to be complete and accurate copies. Any single piece of evidence can be checked against that image and proven to be accurate. 

We now have a situation where, if what Signal says is true, evidence collected with cellebrite *may have been* modified, but you really can't determine if it has or has not. The integrity of *all* evidence collected from Cellebrite is questionable from here on out. You simply can't prove that it has not been changed.    

I, for one, am eager to see how (if) cellebrite responds to this. They are going to have to be able to somehow demonstrate that this is untrue (I don't think they can). There is no way on earth they could rewrite their software to NOT have these vulnerabilities since they are at the very foundation of the software. And if Apple hasn't authorized the use of those EXEs and DLLs (I highly doubt they have, given their stance on the security of their devices) a cease and desist will be issued, rendering the software unusable on Apple devices. 

I'm also eager to see how this could start a precedent for a focus on other forensics tools. Cellebrite is just one of the big names, but there are plenty of other tools out there that I can only imagine could be caught up in a wave like this.",1619188213.0,1

"Yea, that was the case until smartphones like 12 years ago or so. App Store and Play Store have always taken cuts since they are centralized markets. One can still buy software for Windows or MacOS without paying a cut as long as you buy it off of the app store, but you'll miss out on thing it to your account and there'll be, at least in the case of Apple, less quality control. 

The software market isn't what it was 10-20 years ago as a whole. I don't think it's possible to buy Photoshop outright anymore, it's a subscription now just like a large portion of other software. It sucks, but also has benefits like cloud sync, saves, and a constantly evolving product that adds features. 

A system like an app store wasn't really possible before, since all the popular OS' are open enough to allow just anyone to install their programs on it. Android and especially iOS are quite more locked up out of the box, that's what allows for such a system. On Android and jailbroken iOS it's possible to install alternative stores but most of those also take a cut of some sort. On Android you can install without a store as well, but I don't know how popular that is outside of piracy. 

That's one explanation, the other is that the developers of the phones/OS realized the value they produce so now they are asking to be adequetly compensated for it, especially since it's possible. Not unlike a fresh grad who takes a shitty job for experience and eventually realizes they are worth way more than what they are getting. 

Just plain money or greed even, is also a factor but it's not the only one. 

In Apples case, the App Store quality and iOS security is way better than the Google equivalents. This is because Apple's system is so locked down, Apps and their design have strict requirement and Apple actually checks them.

First of all, these aren't available yet and there are no teardowns available. So it's not clear how difficult it is to get into the thing in order to repair something if it breaks. For the user or for a trained technician.

As for the upgradability, the author complains about things like RAM, CPU, GPU not being replaceable. I would challenge you to find a similar product in which this is the case. I can't find teardowns of all the similar desktops (including those by Lenovo or HP), but on the Microsoft Surface Studio, another slim all-in-one, you can't replace any of those things either.

Slim desktops are essentially like laptops these days. Motherboard with everything soldered to it. It's true that the design decision of slim/light dictates this sort of thing, so you could solve the repairability issue by stopping the fight for thinner/lighter, but this is clearly not just an Apple problem. It's not like Apple is making thin/light products and everyone else is making thicker heavier computers in order to preserve easy component access.

You mean the teardown for https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Studio+Teardown/74448

With user replaceable hard drive, ssd, Modular SD card slot, Modular power supply. Now I will give you the Ram and CPU are soldered on although the CPU being soldering on is that not odd and not insurmountable silly to replace. The ram is another matter but while nearly impossible to replace its easier than the integrated onto chip than the m1. For 99.99% of shops its a wash either way

From the IFixIt teardown a screen replacement seems extremely easy and not tied to the device either even if a bit expensive. You are correct that we don't have a teardown for the new iMac but we can look at the ipad, iphones, macbooks, and imac minis for guides at how terrible it will be.

Most, read every except apple with few exceptions, do not solder ram or ssd or hdd. While the CPU is soldered and most GPUS are on laptops, thats different than what apple is doing here.

As for the slim/light, that is almost entirely apples doing and sadly others are following and yes many both in this thread and just about everyone preaching for right of repair is as well. Apple is also far more than the low hanging fruit as other manufactures (maybe not microsoft) do sell replacement parts and allow upgrades such as the above mentions ram, ssd, hdd of which apple does not.

None of Apple’s iPhones or MacBook earned above a 7, with 10  being the top score — making the company a “C student at best,” the  website [Grist](https://grist.org/technology/apple-finally-admits-its-products-are-difficult-to-repair/)  noted. Other manufacturers like Microsoft and Samsung fared about the  same. Equipped with this knowledge, consumers can make better choices  about which products to buy. If unrepairable gadgets don’t sell,  manufacturers will change course.   
&gt;  
&gt;France is not alone in stepping into this  mess. The movement is in the United States as well. More than a dozen  states are considering so-called right-to-repair legislation, a [rare bipartisan](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/climate/right-to-repair.html)  concern centered on the idea that manufacturers should not restrict  access to information and parts that would allow independent shops to  fix busted gadgets.  
&gt;  
&gt;The New York State Assembly member Patricia Fahy will hold a [virtual town hall](https://twitter.com/PatriciaFahy109/status/1385229186944708609)  on the topic May 5. Anyone can attend. And the Federal Trade Commission  is expected to release a long-delayed report soon on repair  restrictions in consumer technology that could set the stage for a  bigger push from the Biden administration.

**While the US leads in tech, Brussels is setting the standards for online privacy and regulating AI**

The Americans innovate and the Europeans regulate. That was a simple way of explaining the interaction between government and the technology business. It is still broadly true. The European Union is not quite an innovation desert but nothing rivals Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook or Microsoft. The US has flubbed questions such as internet privacy, whereas the EU is a rule-making superpower. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of 2018 has become, in effect, a global standard.

Now the EU is flexing its muscles again, issuing proposed regulations on the hottest topic in digital governance: artificial intelligence, or AI. That is well overdue. Computer decision-making can determine whether you get a job, a loan, a home or a date, as well as what news or ads appear on your screen. The software that makes these decisions is almost impenetrable. It is “trained” on databases that may have serious flaws. If computers learn to make decisions based on information about young white men, say, they may botch choices involving women, older people or those with different skin colour.

Proposals for ethical AI abound but so far only the EU is trying to codify in law principles such as fairness and transparency. The result is far from perfect. Its 100-page white paper is replete with exceptions. A few things are banned outright, such as what it calls “subliminal” manipulation of individual decision-making. Facial recognition is tightly regulated (finding missing children is fine; Chinese-style population surveillance isn’t). Penalties are hefty: up to 6 per cent of a violator’s global revenues.

Lobbying over the details in the coming years will be intense. All that time and energy will underline the EU’s importance as the global rule-setter. It will also highlight the costs of the legislative vacuum in Washington. When American lawmakers decided ten years ago that internet privacy was none of their business, they in effect handed power to Brussels. They may not make that mistake again but Marietje Schaake, a former Dutch MEP now at Stanford University, argues neither the EU’s top-down regulation nor the US’s corporate-focused model are enough.",1619461059.0,1

"This is such a stupid take...

People are asking for these devices to not be bound to exclusively OEM parts and to not have 38 different proprietary screws in them, so that it is not impossible to attempt a repair without the matching proprietary tools.

e.g. Apple DOES NOT do back glass repairs for their iPhone 11s. They will throw out your fully functional device to the colossal mountain of e-waste because of cosmetic issues.

Is there any reason the back panel of glass on a “thin and light” phone should be too hard for the manufacturer to replace? Is Apple’s shitty design philosophy a burden for the consumer to carry? 

Are you suggesting that we should throw out entire automobiles because of a dented body panel or a cracked windshield? Or is everyone just supposed to buy a tank to drive instead because those are more durable and “there are literally hundreds of them.”

You’re arguing that because 99% of companies give people an easy to break, impossible to repair device, it’s the consumers fault it inevitably becomes unusable?

* Your neighbor down the street may not care about any of that, and just wants ""the thinnest and lightest Ultrabook"" (and doesn't care if any of it is ""repairable"".

* If you force them to make it ""open-source and repairable"".. now you end up having all these dozens (or 100's) of little mom and pop shops that have to stock every conceivable combination of parts (because you never know who or what kind of problem is going to walk through the door). Now you have dozens (or 100's) of different stockpiles of components all ""aging-out"" .. plus on top of that you can't possibly ensure all those dozens or hundreds of mom and pop shops are properly recycling all that excess components. 

We already went through this (back in the 70's and 80's and 90's). It was a nightmare. Fragmenting the supply-chain and fragmenting the repairability does not ""improve things"". It just makes everything more messy and inefficient and wasteful.",1619479204.0,1

"Tile is not arguing that Apple stole their idea, but that Apple's allowing an integration with iOS in Tile they wouldn't allow for external services. And that is an anti-trust case. Just like Windows had it's ""secret APIs"" that only Microsoft products used, which was part of the argument against IE. The fact that they're different isn't a safety net, it could even make things worse, if the AirTag does something that Tile simply cannot.

This is not clearly the case of Apple replacing a bloated over-engineered solution with a simple, included, basic and good-enough solution. If it is then that's great. If it isn't though, Apple will have to open APIs to allow competing products to do interesting decisions that Apple didn't, helping both companies make a better product (just like a lot of Android innovation ended up in the iPhone).",1619483638.0,1
"Fast evolution? Are you joking?

Look at how far the fridges have come in the last decade: they barely changed at all, both in form and in function. If your fridge from 2010, 2000 or even *the 80s* is still going strong, there is no reason to upgrade. The same can be said about most home appliances: washing machines, stoves, microwave ovens, electric kettles, heaters, etc.

Even with TVs, a decade is more than a reasonable timeframe. A solid TV from 2010 probably has thicker bezels and tops out at 1080p60, but that's it. If you think that 1080p is good enough, why upgrade? The returns on increases in screen resolution are diminishing, especially if you sit far enough from the screen: today's 4k panels might have a good two decades in them before they *start* nearing their moral obsolescence.

It makes sense to make decade-long manufacturer warranty and support mandatory on those appliances. Hell, I'd make that two decades for anything I listed above except maybe, maybe, TVs.

-

Of course, there are areas where ""fast evolution of technology"" is very much a thing - mostly the ones that ride the silicon industry. A PC from 2000 was unusable garbage by 2010. A smartphone from 2010 was trash by 2020. But even in those areas, the crazy performance gains are tapering off. A solid PC from 2010 is still a usable PC in 2020, GPU aside. A flagship smartphone from 2020 might remain usable until 2030. Too many ""new technologies"" introduced today are incremental, marginal improvements that even the marketing depts of titans like Apple have trouble hyping up, and with that, the operational lifetime of those electronic devices grows. The warranty periods, support periods, reliability, durability, repairability? They don't. Long overdue for something to be done about that.",1619483815.0,1

"&gt; Anytime a company (Apple, Microsoft, Linux, etc) releases a new OS,. there's 100's and 100's of improvements, security-fixes and new features ""under the hood"". You may not see 90% of them,.. but those things ""under the hood"" are definitely still helping you.

Firstly, Linux is not a company. It is non-profit and run by the community (which includes corporations who utilise it). 

Secondly, Linux does not really release a new OS like Apple or Microsoft, only new versions of the same kernel which can be continuously upgraded. The kernel is the basis for the OS. Linux itself… isn't really actually an operating system, but a family of operating systems which use the same kernel. 

Thirdly, Linux has no trouble running on decades old hardware. Unlike the Mac OS or Windows, it can be stripped down to still run the same on extremely old hardware. Linux did not drop the 386 processors [until 21 years later in 2012](https://www.zdnet.com/article/good-bye-386-linux-to-drop-support-for-i386-chips-with-next-major-release/), and even then, this is because there was so little demand nobody at all stepped up to maintain it. It still supports the 486 processor, if I recall correctly, which is over 31 years old. Linux is a great example of how one can still see software improvements even on extremely old hardware. This isn't really a counterpoint, but worth mentioning in this context. 

Pedantry aside, Linux is… actually a pretty good example of under-the-hood improvements. Since the Linux kernel is an under-the-hood thing itself… every improvement to it is under the hood. 

&gt; &gt; Also recent hardware and software updates not bringing that much big of improvement or change...
&gt;
&gt; That's just not true though. If you look at iPhones for example.. in the roughly 10 years that iPhones have been around,. they're demonstrably different (and more ""feature-rich"") than when they were 1st introduced.

I think they are talking about the past 5 years, not past 10 years. I likely would not have much trouble using Android 4.4 if not for software compatibility. In fact, lately it seems Android updates have been making the OS worse rather than better so much so it would almost be preferable… if not for the very important compatibility and even more important security concerns. So, I guess that also counts as under-the-hood improvements. 

My phone is from 2014 (still gets updates to the latest Android versions though via LineageOS) and is only lately getting slow, mostly from badly-written software and perhaps a few too many background apps. Better-written software, like RedReader, runs great as always. And my computer uses processors from 2009 and runs quite well. 

Improvements get increasingly visible after 5 or 10 years, so they do exist… but a 2 year update cycle, in my opinion, is quite excessive. Things should be built to last, and hardware upgrades should be something for improving speed, not something users are forced into by planned obsolescence or increasingly badly-written software.",1619495101.0,1

&gt; but a 2 year update cycle, in my opinion, is quite excessive.

Good to know. Also… I did allude to it not actually really disagreeing with the core points in my last couple sentences. That is why I called it pedantry. That part was a correction, but only for the details rather than the comment as a whole. I was (and am) a bit tired, so may not have conveyed that too clearly. 

&gt; There's a lot of choices out there. Different people with different priorities or preferences should all be able to make different choices.

&gt;
&gt;* if Neighbor 3 houses down is a career Microsoft fan (Xbox and Zune and everything).. Great!.. shouldn't that person also be free to choose whatever works for them ?

I agree. I lean libertarian. I think people should vote with their wallet against planned obsolescence, but I support people's right to choose otherwise. Choice is how we opt out of exploitive products today. I would hate to see that taken away. 

&gt; But that's not a thing. There's no Law of Physics that requires people to ""upgrade all their devices on an exact 2 year schedule"". People individually CHOOSE to do that,. but that's just a choice they make,.. it's not a requirement. Nobody is going to die if they hold out for 3 years. or 3.5 years. Or 5 years or whatever. 

The 2 year upgrade cycle is a function of: 

1. People's expectation that this is how long a device should last. 

2. Manufacturers only providing software updates for this long, restricting people's ability to go beyond this by using locked bootloaders, and designing hardware in a repair-hostile way. 

The second behaviour is the behaviour I oppose, and encourage people to avoid by buying from companies who do not engage in it. 

&gt; I just don't see the problem here. If you walk by a random person on the street.. why the F do you care what products (or what replacement cycle) they arrived at (due to their own preferences or needs) 

Excessive upgrades exacerbate climate change and environmental damage, and if I make people aware of alternatives this may also help them by allowing them to get more reliable technology that will still work even if they can't upgrade and save money. 

&gt; Why is that even your place to judge or critique ?..

Climate change threatens huge amounts of death and catastrophe in the future. I would even say it threatens human extinction, if humans weren't so adaptable to surviving even in the most hostile environments. I think this threat is enough to make avoiding as much as possible a worthy goal. Plus, again, it can be helpful to individuals to have more reliable technology and save money. I won't force it on anyone, but want to encourage it as much as possible. 

&gt; they're standing right in front of you in the coffee-shop line and they pull out an iPhone 12,.. do you just immediately assume ""they're stupid and wasted money on a thing they don't need""..

No, of course not. Maybe they just upgraded from an ancient broken phone. Or, maybe they have some compelling reason to upgrade more frequently, that they have while others do not. Individual variation makes imposing one set of judgement on everybody very impractical. Plus, I don't like judging people; it is stressful and creates bad vibes. Instead, I focus on how to improve for the future. What is done, is done. All we can do is try to improve what happens next. 

&gt; . .You don't even know them (or how they arrived at their decision to buy that produce). 

I agree, and just explained the exact same point before reading this sentence… Sometime maybe I should try reading the entire comment before responding to it point by point… 

&gt; I just don't get the rampant judgementalism. 

Yeah, I really dislike judgementalism. I prefer to focus on improvement, not shaming. Shaming is horrible and unproductive and often makes people really unwilling to change their minds! Sometimes it is effective, if someone is already leaning towards agreeing with a point (as was the case for me with veganism), but more often than not, it just turns people off of the cause. 

&gt; Why not just let people buy what they want to buy. It's their decision. Not yours. 

I agree. My goal is to change or at least inform their decision as much as I can, not to force anything on anyone. Although forcing it could currently be justified for environmental reasons… forcing it on everyone would have the problem of not accounting for exceptions to the rule. 

&gt; why does your opinion even matter in their purchasing-choice?.

My points are getting redundant at this point due to responding point-by-point instead of to the entire thing, but since I've already kept the format until basically to the end… 

Because climate change is extremely important to mitigate, because it helps people not lose access to their technology if they are unable to buy upgrades, because it can help them save money, and because it means better technology on the used market. The latter 3 points, being reason to help people get a more informed opinion (they may not care about these advantages; it is their choice), and the first point being reason to actually try to convince them of it rather than just inform because it is important for the future survival of everyone to mitigate climate change as much as we possibly can.",1619499608.0,1

"Ok i will admit that i didn't really read that article, i heard about the lightbulb cartel years ago and wanted to show you an outside source so i just google it and picked whatever good link i saw. But now after a good night sleep, i've read it and i don't think it's really proving me wrong.

* The cartel failed, because among other things makers could not control the market, but also among other things is 'What ultimately killed Phoebus, however, was World War II. As the members’ host countries went to war, close coordination became impossible. The cartel’s 1924 agreement, which was supposed to last until 1955, was nullified in 1940.'

&gt;Over the course of nearly a decade, the cartel succeeded in this quest. The average life of a standard reference lightbulb produced in dozens of Phoebus members’ factories dropped by a third between 1926 and fiscal year 1933–34, from 1,800 hours to just 1,205 hours. At that point, no factory was producing bulbs lasting more than 1,500 hours. 

&gt; In fiscal year 1926–27, for instance, the cartel sold 335.7 million lightbulbs worldwide; four years later, sales had climbed to 420.8 million. What’s more, despite the fact that the actual costs of manufacturing were dropping, the cartel maintained more or less stable prices and therefore higher profit margins. **From its inception until the end of 1930, the cartel retained its overwhelming share of a growing market.**

* as for the cost spent, the article only mentioned the comparison vs poor-quality Japanese handmade bulbs, it didn't mention the other larger manufacturer that weren't part of the cartel

&gt;As the cartel continued its policy of artificially elevated prices, competitors spotted a golden opportunity to sell cheaper, if often inferior-quality, goods. Particularly threatening was the flood of inexpensive bulbs from Japan. Although Tokyo Electric was a cartel member, it had no control over the hundreds of smaller, family-owned workshops that produced bulbs almost entirely by hand. Japanese consumers apparently preferred the higher-quality products sold by the larger manufacturers, and so the majority of these cheap, handmade bulbs were exported to the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, where they sold for a fraction of the price of a Phoebus bulb and well below the average production cost of a cartel bulb, too. From 1922 to 1933, Japan’s annual output of incandescent bulbs grew from 45 million to 300 million.

* a tradeoff that call be avoided 

&gt; Of course, given the collective ingenuity of the cartel’s engineers and scientists, it should have been possible to design a lightbulb that was both bright and long-lived. But such a product would have interfered with members’ desire to sell more bulbs. And sell more bulbs they did, at least initially.

and it's not efficient, it just consumed more electricity to produce more light, nothing efficient about that

&gt;A GE flashlight bulb in the precartel days was designed to last longer than three changes of batteries. This life span was then cut to two battery changes, and in 1932 the GE engineering department proposed that the bulb last no longer than one battery. .... That boost in illumination, he suggested, “would be acceptable to all flashlight users” **despite the fact that the higher current would shorten not just the bulb’s life but also the battery’s.**

&gt;It does not matter how many people believe in conspiracy theories like planned obsolescence. Laws are about truth, not belief, and this is why apple and epson were not found guilty. 

Laws are NOT about truth, laws are man-made, laws are not be all-encompassing, laws are not perfect. 

&gt;Again, no manufacturer is dumb enough to pay his engineers to sabotage its own product. Planned obsolescence conspiracy theories all stem from the idea there is no competition and every actor works hand in hand with everyone. Capitalism guarantees it does not work like that.

yes, i agree with that, not any manufacturer can do that
&gt;Planned obsolescence tends to work best when a producer has at least an oligopoly.[4] Before introducing a planned obsolescence, the producer has to know that the customer is at least somewhat likely to buy a replacement from them (see brand loyalty). In these cases of planned obsolescence, there is an information asymmetry between the producer, who knows how long the product was designed to last, and the customer, who does not. When a market becomes more competitive, product lifespans tend to increase.[5][6] For example, when Japanese vehicles with longer lifespans entered the American market in the 1960s and 1970s, American carmakers were forced to respond by building more durable products

It's not really a conspiracy, i think you should think about it more like a strategy to boost sales and encourage over-consumption. A problem not unique to the tech sector(there is also a problem of [fast fashion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGF3ObOBbac)), it's just that repairing can be a solution for unnecessary over-consumption and e-waste.",1619535987.0,1

"Lets make it simple. I am not going to convince you, I am too bad at expressing myself and no one can be convinced like that. 

Only you can act to broaden your viewpoint. I can only guarantee if you do, you will eventually conclude that planned obsolescence is the fantasy consumers tell themselves so they do not have to take responsibility for their buying choices.  The whole theory is about having your hand forced, of course by evil companies. Yet the first thing you see when you actually work in tech is the opposite. Companies only do what people want and can afford, not what people openly say they want because these are mostly lies.

Again, no one forces people to buy iphones, and everyone knows apple policies about their products. Ask yourself why. Why would people keep buying trendy, expensive and fragile phones instead of heavier, bulkier, easy to fix and hard to break phones ? the answer is ""because people would rather have an expensive fancy phone"". Simple as that.

If you want to know what happens in R&amp;D and the various industrial processes including marketing and aftersales,  get a job in there and see for yourself.

&gt; Planned obsolescence is the fantasy consumers tell themselves so they do not have to take responsibility for their buying choices.

""In 1924, [...] To maintain unit sales, General Motors executive Alfred P. Sloan Jr. suggested annual model-year design changes to convince car owners to buy new replacements each year, with refreshed appearances. [...] Sloan often use the term dynamic obsolescence,[10] but critics coined the name of his strategy planned obsolescence.""

""The origins of phrase planned obsolescence go back at least as far as 1932 with Bernard London's pamphlet Ending the Depression Through Planned Obsolescence.[11] The essence of London's plan would have the government impose a legal obsolescence on personal-use items, to stimulate and perpetuate purchasing. [...] By his definition, planned obsolescence was **""Instilling in the buyer the desire to own something a little newer, a little better, a little sooner than is necessary.""**""

As you can see the concept was first introduced by critics or experts in the industry not consumers. You don't really say that a manipulation victim is the one to blame because they're too vulnerable to impulses to buy something they don't need because it's a little new.

Of course if it's a few who fall victim to these practices then that's their problem but when it gets applied to the whole world population then it's a social, economical and environmental problem that needs to be addressed.

"Antitrust cases often focus on dominance in one market being used to gain an advantage in another market. For most people there are only really 2 phone base choices - iPhone or some kind of android phone. So apple has a significant hold on that’s space. 

Now for many years, apple wouldn’t allow any other maps app to have the same rights and functionality as apple maps. One clear example is that while you could run Google maps, you couldn’t do so on car play. That made a lot of people use apple maps on car play who would have otherwise used something else. This meant apple used their significant iPhone base to gain an advantage in the maps game. 

Same went for music apps until yesterday. Didn’t matter what your preferred music app choice was, on an iPhone, it would try and force you to apple’s music app. That means that some people who were trying to use other apps would give up and use apples app. 

If you’re on Reddit, you’re probably the type of person who’d do the work to have a phone holder to run Google maps instead of using apple maps on car play. Or just reopen Spotify and search for the song.

Thats the thing; no you cannot, because sometimes it just is not possible, and sometimes it could be but the ""expensive"" part of the equation will be going through the roof and out of buyers budget. 

From a company's point of view, this is the choice to face:

option1: train teams of 50 engineers, have space and material for them to work,  then make them work to improve an existing design into something simpler to repair in a very limited time frame so the competitor does not sell something before the window closes. Then store spare parts, and train people to install them, and have specific repair hardware, and adjust selling price accordingly.

option2: ask the sales department about the product life cycle, get told customers usually keep their phone 1 to 2 years.

No sane manager will ever pick option 1.

"&gt;Social media and modern technology companies tend to create their own incumbent barriers to stop competition

Stifle competition? There tons of social media options, manyanh communities with dozens-hundreds of millions of people. Whatever they're doing to ""stifle"" competition clearly isn't working out too well

&gt;Most of them are either based on features or algorithms, but a lot of them are simply driven by user habits. Once a service gets a mature userbase in a niche it's an incredibly expensive proposition to replicate it and compete.

This is pure consumer choice, why are you advocating that I need the company of my pastime shit posting website broken up? Why do you feel that the end consumer can't be trusted to just go elsewhere? Or are we going to pretend that myspace, mcdonald's, and jcpenney's are the juggernauts they once were?

&gt;First mover advantage and network effect have made companies like amazon and facebook natural monopolies.

Objectively false, a natural monopoly occurs based around limited resources, internet bandwidth and the human proclivity for useful entertainment and luxuries are arguably limitless. Amazon competes with apple, google, facebook, ebay, walmart, kmart, publix, giant, walgreens, home depot etc. Etc. Etc. Etc. They are nowhere near a monopoly. Facebook has a similar list of competitors, it competes with your phone company, texting, reddit, snapchat, line, weebo,  movies, games etc. It's an entertainment luxury and again, it's a social media site, they can easily go the way of myspace if someone else designs something better, which honestly looks like it's coming in the next 10 years since facebook is getting more and more stale.

&gt;Can I create my own service to compete with facebook? Sure. Will I ever be able to create one that's as integrated and has the userbase without a trillion dollars? Probably not. 
Facebook destroyed myspace, a multi-billion dollar social media website with first mover advantage and the network effect without spending trillions. Why wouldn't yours do the same? 

&gt;Even if I tried, they would use monopolistic behavior and further investment to make it harder for me to compete. 

How? There's plenty of competitors that started after facebook that have plenty of skin in the game.

&gt;The thing to think about here is that companies like standard oil grew due to their ability to take public goods and leverage them with other natural monopolies in order to grow and lock out the market. They had access to the legal system and central banking (public goods) and used other natural monopolies (canals, railroads and telegraphs) in order to aggregate information and first chase horizontal then vertical integration of their product stream. 

Yes

&gt;facebook buys instagram. Standard oil builds a price index of the national market via telegram, facebook builds beacon to track user browsing off their site. The situations don't exactly line up but there are enough similarities that we need to examine regulation

Heavily disagree, comparing an inherently limited resource like oil to a nearly infinite resource like bandwidth and users is just completely unreasonable and betrays an ignorance to the stark fundamental differences therein between the two markets. You can't power a car, plane, or train economically with anything other than oil, humanity *needs* oil, it's irreplaceable in many applications. 
Facebook? Facebook provides entertainment and a communication medium, you don't *need* facebook to be entertained, facebook isn't stopping people from being able to thoroughly enjoy other forms media. The comparison is just completely unreasonable

&gt;You can just label social media a luxury good, but because their business is so heavily built on communication. Those arguments start flying out the window quickly. Every other single communication medium involves heavy regulation in order to ensure the public good. At the very minimum we need to start pushing for equal access and transparency on social media.

No they don't? Youtube isn't heavily regulated (communication medium) twitter isn't heavily regulated, snapchat isn't heavily regulated, your texts aren't heavily regulated, discord isn't heavily regulated.

"&gt;You can’t have a monopoly over your own products and App Store.

The App Store is very similar to Amazon. They are both platforms which third party sellers and developers use as storefronts to sell their product. The App Store has strict guidelines for what apps are allowed to use their storefront. This is not inherently wrong.

But, there is a little talked about fact regarding these huge storefront platforms. Amazon, and, by extension, the App Store, are not technically monopolies. They are, however, monopsonies. They don't want to control the production of a product, they want to control the purchase of said product. 

They become monopsonies by trying to become the only storefront for sellers to use. Apple has already achieved this and Amazon is close to achieving it if they haven't already. This is similar to Walmart overtaking all other retail outlets and becoming the only market where producers can sell their products.

This means two things:

1. Unlimited bargaining power over producers.
2. If Walmart/Amazon/The App Store collapses, there will be no way for producers to sell their products to consumers unless they make their own infrastructure.

lol don't be naive. It counts for nothing. Actions speak louder than words. Let me give you on obvious red flag that undermines their ""willingness"" for privacy.

Did you read Signal's recent blog about their analysis of Celebrite? https://signal.org/blog/cellebrite-vulnerabilities/

&gt; It seems unlikely to us that Apple has granted Cellebrite a license to redistribute and incorporate Apple DLLs in its own product, so this might present a legal risk for Cellebrite and its users.

5 years ago when Cellebrate was making waves that they could crack iPhones and Android for law enforcement do you not believe Apple definitely acquired one of these units to secure their phones better. I'm sure they did. It's how any good company priding themselves on security makes their product better.

Signal discovered Cellebrite was distributing their software with Apple's drivers which was against Apple's TOS. If Signal discovered this then Apple definitely must have discovered the same 5 years ago. And yet there was no lawsuits about it... until this week when Signal made this information public:

https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/n06jta/cellebrite_physical_analyzer_no_longer_fully/

Naive people would say oh Cellebrite won't crack iPhones now because Signal said it would distribute these ""aesthetically pleasing files"" that exploit Cellebrite devices... yet Signal will distribute these files for both Android and iPhone, so why did Signal only stop hacking iPhones? Because now the word is out that Cellebrite was violating Apple TOS be redistributing these files, which Apple knew about probably for years and since it's public news now Apple must act accordingly.

So why would Apple allow Cellebrite to distribute these files for years up until this week? My guess is that Apple was actively working with law enforcement and new about Cellebrite distributing their software and agreed to remain quiet in exchange for some favors.

I personally don’t agree to Facebook making a profit out of me when I don’t use their service, yet they’ve been known to make shadow profiles of basically everyone on the internet (a “profile” that doesn’t have an identity attached, other than through that cookie they’ve placed on your computer/phone without telling you, but contains all your actions, search history, preferences etc, where they can discern a lot of information about you) and they’ll follow you across websites and track your behaviour around the web. All to serve personalised ads in your Facebook feeds? Fuck that, imo. There’s a reason Facebook kicked up a massive stink when Apple announced their tracking transparency feature in iOS 14.5 and they know that given the choice, their users will opt out of allowing Facebook to track them. 

We’ve seen in the past that this data collected from their users can be heavily abused to manipulate society (Cambridge analytica, for example) and spread masses of misinformation which Facebook have failed to do anything about. See the anti-vax movement, flat earth society, even the coronavirus conspiracies. 

Facebook just had 500+ million of its users data published/leaked on the internet earlier this month, where all the data was extracted using legitimate Facebook API’s up to around summer 2019. This wasn’t some clever hacker who breached their defences and extracted the info from their databases. Facebook actively gave them that data for free until they got publicly lambasted for it and locked it down.

I want my privacy from Facebook because I don’t want them to start manipulating the way I think by serving what they think are “relevant” articles, in the guise of adverts. I also don’t want them to make a profit out of me whilst I don’t use their services, or for them to build a profile of me without my consent where they’ve been know to abuse it and give it away for free to whoever asked anyway.

"As mentioned, there are several differences between the Google App Store and the Apple App Store search optimization. However, the biggest difference lies in the description. While iTunes provides a keyword field, you need to add the keywords in your app description for Google App Store.

You need to strategically add your keywords within the app description to improve its searchability. If you are familiar with online marketing and SEO, this won’t be a problem at all. All you need to do is find relevant search terms for your app and use them in your description.

The trick is to use as many relevant keywords as possible but make sure they are not repetitive. And given the fact that Google allows you add a maximum of 4,000 characters in the description field, you will have ample opportunities to add them. However, don’t just stuff your keywords in the description as it will be considered as spamming by the search giant. Besides, adding a bunch of meaningless keywords won’t help your purpose either. The best practice is to include your target keyword for about 5 times within the description and no more.

But remember your description must make sense; people need to understand the usability of your app and your description is the best tool to do it. You can peruse the content guidelines Google so generously shares with developers.

&gt; &amp;quot;By setting strict rules on the App Store that disadvantage competing music streaming services, Apple deprives users of cheaper music streaming choices and distorts competition,&amp;quot; the EU&amp;#039;s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said in a statement.

**Accelerating revenue and profits suggest an enduring effect from shift to digital during pandemic**

After the world’s largest tech companies enjoyed a boom during the coronavirus pandemic, the expectation was that life would gradually return to normal.

It certainly is not turning out that way.

Big Tech this week reported a surge in growth and profits that stunned Wall Street, delivering powerful evidence that the digital dependence forced on a large part of the world’s population over the past year could have an enduring effect.

The outsized figures amount to a reset in the business world, some tech investors and analysts said. According to this view, the leading digital powers have consolidated their gains from the past 12 months and made themselves an even more indispensable part of work and personal life.

“It’s been an unbelievable tech reporting season for the biggest of the big,” said Jim Tierney, a fund manager at AllianceBernstein.

Big Tech’s increasingly outsized impact on the world of business can best be summed up by just two numbers.

One is the combined revenue of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft, which jumped 41 per cent in the first three months of this year, to $322bn. That points to a rapid acceleration in growth that the leading tech companies have not seen in years, even as they have become some of the world’s biggest companies.

The other is the companies’ profit growth, which has been even more spectacular. After-tax earnings for the five soared by 105 per cent from the previous year, to $75bn. Profit margins rose strongly across the sector, as the biggest companies benefited from the economics of scale while keeping a wary eye on cost expansion during the pandemic.",1619798370.0,1
"[2]

Wall Street already had an appreciation of the defensive power of the tech stocks, believing them to be resilient to the worst of the downturn, said Tierney. Less understood until recent days, he added, was the fact that Big Tech is poised to lead the way out of recession as well, as consumer and business activity surges across their digital platforms.

It is not even as though Big Tech’s latest performance has been flattered by comparison with a weak quarter a year ago. All but Apple were growing by more than 10 per cent before the pandemic hit, though their growth rates had been decelerating.

Underpinning the spectacular financial performance disclosed this week has been a subtle shift in the role that Big Tech’s platforms play in everyday life, said Gene Munster, an investor at Loup Ventures.

“Consumers once valued choice, but what they value now is dependability,” he said. That has led them to concentrate more of their attention and spending on a handful of familiar, easy-to-use platforms like the iPhone, Google’s search engine and Facebook’s Instagram, he added — habits that became deeply ingrained as screens came to play a central part in all facets of life.

Whatever the reason, the first anniversary of the pandemic has been marked by an across-the-board leap in both activity and monetisation on the largest digital platforms. Barring a reversal as the world reopens, that has set a new and higher bar for the tech companies to be measured by.

“The question is, how high is the new plateau?” said Brian Wieser, head of business intelligence at GroupM, part of advertising group WPP. “It’s certainly higher than we expected two weeks ago.”",1619798401.0,1
"Losses. The value of all the teal estate ￼these tech companies have bought would shock you. You see, this whole time companies like Google, Oracle, Apple, Facebook, etc. have not only been buying office space, but residential properties too. Want to hire a coder from Asia and have them on campus? Offer them and their family a home to live in here in the Bay Area. 

Fast forward to today, what’s the point of those people living in a foreign country now? They can go back home with their family and do the same job. So not only is there less demand for office space, but now a housing bubble is going to burst when all these tech firms have to sell their homes and condos at a loss. 

Just look at the housing market in Oregon and Seattle. It’s a sellers market. For every one house being sold, there’s 10+ buyers making offers from California. People are spending 20% over asking price. I’m a renter in OR and the owner wants to sell the house, so my roommate and I are getting paid four months rent to break our lease and leave early. The market is not like that in the Bay Area.",1619798448.0,-1

Meanwhile, the tech companies have taken advantage of their deep ties with millions of users to extend their reach deeper into some of the services delivered over their platforms. Apple’s move into services, once disdained by Wall Street as an uninteresting sideline to its gadgets, contributed to a profit jump that lifted its gross profit margin to more than 42 per cent — a breakout from the level of around 38 per cent that had held over many quarters.

At Amazon, meanwhile, newer services have brought a transformation in the company’s profit profile. That includes the growth of the Amazon Web Services cloud platform, as well as advertising — as seen in a 73 per cent leap in the company’s “other revenue” category, which consists mainly of ads, in the first quarter.

The result was a record quarterly profit for a company once notorious for its persistent losses. Amazon’s $8.1bn in after-tax earnings in the quarter was equivalent to the company’s net earnings in its entire first 22 years of existence.

Amid the euphoria on Wall Street, concerns about potential intervention by regulators to curb the power — and profits — of Big Tech were briefly forgotten. Shares in all but Apple were at or very close to all-time highs in the wake of the latest figures.

There were few other worries to spoil the party. An end to the strong secular growth trends that have lifted Big Tech could loom before too many years, said Tierney. But he added: “How many years can Microsoft grow 50 per cent in the cloud business, and how many years can Google’s advertising keep growing at 30 per cent? There’s no sign of them hitting the wall yet.”",1619798476.0,1

"&gt;	The one I would most like to see change is Apple start allowing other browsers. Today they only allow a skin over their browser engine.

Honestly, I agree with most of your post except this. Like it or not, the not allowing other rendering engines is a security issue, and is about ensuring consistency on iOS. Cookies are shared between webview windows in apps, ensuring you are logged in everywhere. Also it ensures that browsers abide by the same privacy standards/settings across the OS.

It really has very little to do with their business goals. And it doesn’t really interfere with other browsers their business goals. Like Chrome on iOS still has pretty much all of the user facing features that you would expect.",1619798874.0,1
