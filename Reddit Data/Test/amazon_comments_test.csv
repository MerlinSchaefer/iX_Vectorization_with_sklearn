"As a consumer it makes me really upset knowing that any child or person is being exploited by companies I have been a customer. 

Having previously worked at a very large company, I saw how much more important shareholders profits were over everything, even the *safety* of its workers and even the safety of their own customers. 

Then there is the issue that many consumers face, and are ultimately blamed when in reality they were put in the situation by those who ultimately responsible. Millions of people are stuck in a cycle of being paid the lowest wages possible, in order for companies to gain maximum profits, which then leads to them being unable to shop for ethically sourced products because the cost is too high. The very same corporations that exploit their workers are also using it to their advantage to become the only option.

"I mean, if the top complaints from customers who bought the bucket of shit were somehow about the finish of the bucket, then yeah, I probably could. Anyone could, really.

Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with the original logic. It's virtually impossible to make a product that is 100% perfect and will leave everyone 100% satisfied. No one's saying Teslas are literally perfect, at least I'm certainly not. There are inevitably going to be a few imperfections and negative points. And as a potential customer, it's obviously a good idea to read through such opinions/reviews before going ahead with a big purchase. The fact that some media out there is specifically trying to paint as negative a picture as possible about Tesla isn't necessarily a bad thing, as long as you go into reading it armed with the knowledge that that's what's happening -- it's actually convenient that they summarized it all for you. If the bulk of the bad press you see is about fairly minor points that don't sound like they would bother you much personally, that's usually a *really* good sign. 

If, on the other hand, there is literally no bad press to be found, that can (ironically) be a sign that you're not really getting a full picture, and whatever reviews you're seeing are probably biased, whether intentionally (""bought"" or influenced in some way by the company) or unintentionally (bandwagon effect + reddit-style voting system meaning any opinions not aligned with the majority get pushed out of view).

"They don’t need profitability or optimized manufacturing anymore than Amazon needed those things ten years ago. They are selling a car with fewer moving parts than ICE cars, with the most expensive component (battery) dropping in price every year. On top of that they are selling self-driving cars. Do you know how many miles google, et al. drove around with their Google cars? Me neither, but Tesla is uploading the data from 500,000 cars to their learning algorithm. They are doing the self-driving test drives for free while everyone else is paying for it. And the early-adopter states and cities will have more optimized self-driving capability simply by being early adopters. 

Their self-driving car can be bought for ~$38k with parts that decrease in price every year. That includes the self-driving algorithm. The data is what’s valuable and they’re getting it for free. That’s why the stock is high.

"I have a pair of the **New Melomania Touch** earphones: (was on an early Beta test team)

They are better than the previous generation M1s in virtually every way.

* Better connection stability
* Looks better and less pronounced in my ears (imo)
* Soundstage is MUCH wider. Listening to music is *really* enjoyable on the new Touch.
* Touch controls are responsive and easy to use. (can even change volume using the Touch controls, without getting your phone out.
* Build quality is superb - Case feels premium (love the leather finish). Earbuds have a stunning glossy finish and feel really premium

**Sound Profile:** incredible detail and high-end clarity. Sub-bass is most impressive I have heard in a TWE. Really enjoyable. And if I want to change the sound profile, can simply change my EQ in the iOS/ Android App.

**Melomania App:**

* **EQ controls** \- can use the app to change the sound profile: Less bass, more bass, more treble etc..
* **Codec Selection** \- (Love this) Android users will want to make sure they're on the aptX codec (better sound quality and better bluetooth stability), the app can make sure you're on this codec. If you're using an iPhone, will put you on AAC (better than SBC codec)
* Turn each individual touch control on/off if you don't use it. Firmware updates, Switch between 'High-Performance Mode' and 'Low Power Mode' (HPM sounds better and still 7 hours battery life!)

If you're looking for an earbud with incredible Sound Quality, great battery life, great build quality. I really have to recommend these. They're going to give the big players a run for their money!

"Keep in mind that organized labor unions arose during a period when there were basically no laws to protect labor rights - even to the point where violence was frequently used to crack down on organizing efforts.

It is inherent to the nature of capitalist employment, because without workers, a business can’t really make or sell anything.

With lax labor laws, an employer can fire and replace a group of workers who are trying to organize. But, practically speaking, they can’t fire everyone without destroying their source of revenue. Amazon may be able to shut down the warehouse that’s trying to organize in Alabama, for example.

The old employees couldn’t do anything, because the reason they fired wasn’t because they were trying to unionize, but it’s because “they didn’t go to work that day.” The employees who had vacation time and pto were allowed to come back though. They just get watched by managers.

(Source on the last part: although it wasn’t my warehouse it happened at, I was part of “lower” management and was told to listen to my co workers for talks or plans. Even though I would never have ratted out my coworkers if they did talk, they were like family.)

"&gt; Is it a bad thing to not worry about burnout, whether overtime pay even exists, benefits?

It's basically a given overtime doesn't exist in IT. Yes, probably because we're not unionized. But the question is: would overtime pay offset the reduced potential for raises? In my situations, not really. I've not yet had a job in the last decade where more than a 40 hour work week was the norm. That's an accusation that gets thrown around a lot about Amazon especially, but EU labor laws are pretty clear (where lots of my team is based), and overtime is compensated, so even US managers don't expect anyone to pull extra hours unless you're oncall and get paged.

&gt; I too can negotiate for a massive raise by leaving, or by getting enough attention to be offered a non-union position (though these don't pay better than union positions in my org). 

Then why wouldn't you? I've got a wife, kids, a house, and retirement to look at. Why would you deliberately limit your earning potential and retirement outlook by not going after the value you think you're worth? 

&gt; I'm not going to convince you here, this argument is a very very old one, but to answer the $15k raise thing, why weren't you making that $15k multiple years in a row to start with? 

Good question. I was fresh out of school with no work history of value under my belt. 

&gt; Was it because your skillset improved?

Yes

&gt; If you've gotten that much that fast, did you change positions? 

Partially, yes, partially , no. That decade encompasses 4 different jobs. Promotions within the same company didn't change duties that much (or at all, in the case of Amazon) but did result in pay increases and additional stock. 

But this is also another point. It's common for people in my industry to switch jobs often. The average tenure at Amazon is just over a year -- which is when the 1st year signing bonus ends and the first stocks vest. We switch jobs frequently because we can get these massive pay increases easily and enjoy different problem spaces. 

Unions are probably better suited for people who stay at a job for a longer length of time and plan to be ""lifer"" there, perhaps? If people like me leave jobs after 3ish years, whats a union got to offer?",1609779922.0,1

"Amazon pays reasonably well for tech staff (though you *need* to know what you're worth going in to it, and what comparable salaries are. They will try and just pay you a little over what you were previously earning).

The same goes for Google, they typically pay well.

But pay is only one small part of the picture, and unions are not just focussed on pay.  It's about the entire working environment.

Working in Amazon or AWS on the tech side is often an extremely high pressure, high stress environment, with a high rate of staff burn-out.  There's a heavy expectation of working every hour known to man to get the latest feature or change out the door, especially as you get in towards Re:Invent season (for AWS) where lots of stuff is announced, and head towards the busy 4th quarter of the year (for retail).

They don't particularly care about the burn out because there's always more engineers in the pipe, and they've just sort of stopped caring about the overall cost of replacing a staff member, or the loss caused by the amount of knowledge that just walked out the door.  It's often just accepted as the way things are.

While they'll say everything against such practices, and I believe various tiers of senior management even fully believe what they're saying, they'll often do jack squat to actually fix things.  There's rarely any incentives or targets set on managers to reduce staff turnover rates, or to track and reduce employee hours back towards 40.  All of the incentives have tended to be around shipping features, and hitting various service performance metrics that tend to push against things like reducing staff working hours.",1609780987.0,-1
"That’s not the main reason for turnover as turnover is quite high in most tech and often people even return to the same company years later. The big reason for high faang turnover is job hopping often leads to raises faster. It’s common enough to job hop and get a promotion at the same time. Tenure is pretty bad across most tech companies even ones with very strong employee reviews because of how valuable job hopping is. Amazon is disliked enough that people also likely leave because of work experience, but I don’t think google has that issue at all.


Also general perception among tech people is google is very nice work wise, fb moderate, amazon not nice, Netflix weird given there high willingness to fire and view people like a pro sports team, and Apple not sure (I think moderate). Of course all companies this size have many teams with some much better than others but in general google is very well liked for work life balance and often joked about as a place to retire like Microsoft.",1609781021.0,1

&gt; My employer values me properly, and my union has made sure I'm taken care of accordingly. No muss, no fuss and most importantly no stress. After 20 years in IT chasing raises (never stayed at a job more than 5 years), the last 2 and a bit have been pretty relaxing.

That's awesome! And no reason you can't get that elsewhere though, right? Seems very job dependent like all things in our field.

For example, one of my mentors at Amazon who has been there for a handful years more than me makes just shy of $1,000,000 a year from his RSU grants. He's positioned to retire incredibly comfortably by his mid 40's. He did this after leaving a place with unions (higher education) and going to Amazon. Is his job more stressful now? Sure. But he says it's worth it because he's set for life now. 

&gt; Assuming a competent union - overtime pay, guaranteed PTO, guaranteed sick days, flex days, proper benefits, protection from predatory employers etc. etc. A person can actually ENJOY their job for those 3 years.

That's a fair point. I'll of course counter with I've worked across the spectrum from higher ed to smaller shops, to Amazon, and I've never once disliked my job. I leave because I'm ready to go find another challenge, not because I'm sick of the job or the company. I get this absolutely depends on the person, but it's why a union is basically never discussed with anyone I've ever worked with. We're not stupid, we get it can provide benefits, but it hasn't been necessary with where we're at. That's all. 

&gt; Rather than asking that, why not get an employer that values your worth properly to start with?

Because I haven't seen that, historically. You joined a union after a long job history (20+ years). Would you have started as high without that history? 20 years ago I was 10 years old. Nobody was going to hire me fresh out of college for 6 figures in 2010. And if I had been hired into a union position, would I be just getting small step increases? 

If I look at my wife who literally followed that path (starting in a union, never leaving, getting step increases): yeah. Her pay has not kept up at all. But she keeps paying union dues to her higher ed union.",1609784115.0,1

That's a generalization, but it's the theme of that sub as I've seen it. And I'm not sure a union would get them the result they seemed to want, because they just weren't worth the pay they expected.

Too many people there think because they fix the CEOs laptop at a 10 person company they're worth $120,000 a year minimum. I'd argue if your responsibilities include fixing someones laptop -- generally -- you're probably not at the level where that pay is justified.

Yeah lots of jobs IT have shit hours or shit responsibilities, and perhaps those would benefit from unionization -- hell, most jobs like that certainly would.

"I'm in the UK if that changes anything, but I imagine the trends are near universal.

If you're a recent graduate, a banking graduate programme is usually the best way in- and the definition of 'graduate' is very lax - my intake had a lot of mums-getting-back-to-work which was nice. They dropkick a billion opportunities at you *way* beyond your experience level, pay well with zero experience, and (if you apply yourself and are willing to suck a *teensy* bit of metaphorical corporate dick) you can easily roll off into a managerial-level position. They usually offer the opportunity to choose where within the bank you work too, so you can play around with disciplines before committing. They're usually super competitive, so I wouldn't rely on the idea of getting one, but it's worth a crack!



Otherwise just check job listings and see what they have on there. You'll probably see

* Python, R, a smattering of Java, and Scala are the main languages for data stuff. There's also SAS, Tableau, SQL (obviously). 

* AWS, or another less common platform. Some banks are using Azure but Amazon is king right now. Banks really aren't that high-tech but they try to be, desperately, and familiarity with these tools is key.

* Machine learning is maturing from a data analysis tool to a production service. That means transitioning from running models against static data sets for internal use, to pushing predictions directly to customers. That has a whole host of engineering and regulatory issues.

* Containerisation is vital. Almost everything is a docker image these days. Similarly you'll want to get familiar with devops concepts, config management, orchestration, all that jazz. 

* Distributed processing and storage is all we use. Everything is in Hive, everything is Spark. My docker containers are submitting spark jobs which access hive tables



It's also very useful to have some domain knowledge too:

* Regulatory awareness and industry trends for your area. In the UK two years ago you just had to know of Open Banking's existence and your interview would go well; it's the same in Australia now I believe. I'm sure the US has an equivalent. 

* Some familiarity with risk and control in the financial and corporate sense. 

* Privacy! Read up on GDPR or whatever is the latest regulation in your area for that.







That sounds like a lot but you really don't need all of that for an junior/mid dev role. So long as you can demonstrate that you're a solid programmer and data analyst, a lot of banks will put in the effort to train you because their salaries are generally middle of the pack (but still way above national averages - I'm not complaining!) and they can't just cherry pick unicorn devs. 

Just make sure you can answer basic questions about the other bullet points, and demonstrate you've at least played around with the techy stuff, and you'll find something!

Contrast this with Amazon, where managers are required by company to fire the bottom 10% of their performers every year, so everyone is in a rat race to the top whether you like it or not. There's a reason why the engineers there are some of the unhappiest in the industry.",1609807769.0,-1
"They're not selfish though. They're looking out for their family. When you demand that the other user support unionization are you looking out for them? The vast majority of engineers in tech likely vastly oppose unionization, as the reason why top tier tech firms are paid so well is because they're so selective about their work force.

While I'm not a fan of unionization in general, I can see it making more sense for general unskilled labor. You don't do performance reviews on warehouse workers or assembly line workers. They're literally a cog in the giant supply chain machine or manufacturing process. You could do things like mandate people hit a minimum quota for package scan rate like at Amazon, but making a competition and paying out based on who scans the most also likely incentivizes errors. So in such a case, yes, it makes sense to give a group that generally is weak in bargaining power more help.

OTOH, professional workers like engineers and office workers have a lot more creativity and free reign in their day to day activities. Experienced workers generally set their own schedules, create their own project schedules (at least within their own responsibilities), etc. It's far easier to show off your contributions and negotiate for higher pay, etc. Engineers thrive on being able to excel and then using those accomplishments to push for better pay/roles. Turning everyone into a ""we're just a homogeneous work force"" via unionization generally doesn't bode well.

So when someone who makes $250k is telling you they don't want to unionize and it's not in their best interest to do so, why does it bother you so much to hurl insults out at them? That's their choice to make, and isn't the idea of deciding to unionize recognizing the rights of people to make a choice? Last I checked shoving your desires down someone's throat isn't exactly letting them choose.",1609808943.0,1

&gt; Jack Ma, the 56-year-old billionaire founder of Alibaba and Ant Group, hasn&amp;#039;t been seen publicly in more than two months, Jessica Yun reported for Yahoo Finance on Sunday.

&gt; In late December, Chinese regulators launched an antitrust investigation into Alibaba, the country&amp;#039;s biggest e-commerce company, sometimes referred to as &amp;quot;The Amazon of China.&amp;quot; And in November, China introduced regulations that halted what would have been a massive initial public offering for Ant Group, Ma&amp;#039;s fintech company.

&gt; In a video interview in August 2019, Guo Wengui, who fled China as a fugitive in 2014 and has described himself as a whistleblower exposing corruption in the country, said Ma would likely end up in jail or dead in the next year because China wanted to &amp;quot;Take back&amp;quot; Ma&amp;#039;s lucrative Ant Group.

"To chime in on this one: I have very strong feelings about data, yes it needs to be gathered for various reasons such as software development, ads, data management etc, but there is no reason that data needs to be linked to anything other than a device. For instance, if I order a package from say Amazon, my phone number and address and all other personal data does not need to go anywhere, it should be stored and encoded so that only Amazon’s shipping software can see it, not be sold off to other companies or used to “give me a better shopping experience”. There is a huge difference between data handling for legitimate business such as knowing what website you are on so your password software can give you the right password and then gobbling up your life’s story and sharing it with the world for a buck. Selling personal data should not even exist and robo calling should be illegal, we live in a world where you can give your data in full trust to a company and then two days latter 100 other companies have it. 

The US has a pretty good data handling law already in place called HIPAA, while it has hiccups it’s pretty good for handling personal data with healthcare, sometime along these lines, that is enforced and regulated could allow business to still gather data and even share data that does not have any identifying factors for whatever reasons but keep people’s personal data within just that one company or organization that you decided to offer it to. 

Also when talking about voice recordings and other personal data we should be able to see that as a user, I should be able to track my data and see where it is and even legally request that data to be removed. 

As for volunteered data, that’s on you the user, but you shouldn’t have to dig through a broken hidden UI to see where to turn off location services etc. these items again need regulation. 

Ultimately we can have both, but not without serious regulation and control by an entity that understands technology, data management and by allowing people to see their own data. These things will never happen as long as most politicians are born decades before the internet (not saying people of that generation can’t do the work but most barely know how to google something) and hardly ever spend any time online in the same sense as everyday users (government networks are entirely different than the “free internet” as most people put it when it comes to data handling).

Your pay in Amazon will of course be different if you work SF vs London but it's kind of pointless to compare Amazon to companies whos pay does not compete with Amazons regardless of location.

My entire original point is that there is such a high demand in tech that there is not enough supply to meet that demand. Looking at H1B visas is proof of that, as H1B is given out not because of diversity but because of lack of supply in U.S.",1609884727.0,-1
"I believe anonymity online is key, you should be able to communicate online without anyone being able to watch you

In this digital age, communication online is one of the primary ways we talk to eachother, imagine if in real life, every single conversation had a someone listening, recording, etc..

Anonymity online is how we protect ourselves and it is vital

However, there are side effects, such as improper communication, plus people using these tools to commit crimes

But honestly, crimes committed online in anonymity are mainly drug sales, which in my opinion are better online because it removes violence from the streets, it turns drug wars into.. Amazon delivery

I think for social media, it is the sites responsibility to moderate their own content and control their users, free speech should always be allowed, but where it is harmful, it should be regulated appropriately

If you don't have the Money, you need to opt for cheaper options and those come with the known risks.


I once was someone actually worried about my privacy but after a couple compromises I actually gave up really and I don't know how to escape the situation.

Google knows everything about me by now most likely and  I hate it. The damage is done.

If the product is free, you are the product. Fucking sucks to not have money and chose different options.

Always have been an apple user for mobiles, Windows for PC, Playstation for gaming.

Yes, they all collect Data, Bit they all are different Parties, none of them knows everything.

First my mobile died and I moved to Android because I had no money for a new iPhone, then my ps4 dies and I moved to stadiA, when I bought cyberpunk I did get a free Chromecast so I currently have linked my Amazon Prime with the ccu, Spotify with the ccu and do my gaming through the ccu or PC.

Google knows when I get Up, where and when I have appointments, when I or watch movies, when I Game, whAt Games and for how Long, they know when I Go to bed. They know who s sending me E-Mails and what I search in the web. They know where I Go.


I actually have Changed my search engine to duckduckgo but the search Resultat in Germany really are Not that convincing Most Times, so I use Google again anyways.

If I Had the money I would Chose Playstation again for gaming.

If I Had the money I would get a Second PC and learn Linux.

If I Had the money, I wod get an iPhone again.

If I Had the money I would move my Email to a Host you pay for.

As Said, everyone collects datA but from my understanding it's better to have it spread and Not everything with Google.


I don't have the Money so basically everything i currently do online in some way is running through/ via Google.

I also don't have enough knowledge about that kind of stuff to make the right decisions. I lack the money to experiment and find the right decisions by trial and error.

"&gt; How about instead, we abolish the war on drugs so no demographic is specifically impacted by it?

Your view is that racially neutral legislation is racist. You know damn well that means that you are going to try to replace it with racially biased legislation. You talk about the things you want to tear down, you never talk about what you want to replace them with, because your objection to racial equality under law means that whatever new structures you create are, *by necessity*, going to be baised in the way you want them to be.

&gt; I dunno if you're implying reparations -- if they ever did happen -- would go to rich black people, but they probably wouldn't.

""Well probably only racially discriminate against you a little, not as much as you're implying.""

If you think my value is only 50% of a black person's value, we are not going to be able to compromise on 75%, even though you think that's reasonable. We're not going to be able to compromise at 90%, even though you think you're being generous. If you discriminate against me, if you push hatred and contempt and dismissal of me, if you can't view me as a human being with an inherent right to equality the way Martin Luther King did, *then we are enemies*. Period.

&gt; I want the opiod ridden communities of appalachia to get just as much investment as the poor black urban core.

That's completely at odds with Critical Race Theory. Remember, those poor white people, like all poor white people, had all kinds of advantages and lived in a system designed to make them rich. If they failed, it's because they're totally abysmally worthless examples of human trash.

But the poor people in urban black communities are the opposite. They're only poor because they've been held down by white evils, wheras without them they'd *naturally* rise to prominence because black people are naturally inclined to rise to prominence when not held down by white evil.

I cannot really believe you care about white people equally when you follow a dogma that specifically highlights white evil and downplays black evil, and highlights black heroism while completely ignoring even the possibility that there could be *anything* good about white people.

&gt; Bro I'm a socialist, they're not going to ally with me regardless lol.

Isn't it weird how your ally in social justice is rich college boards, massive monolithic mega-corporations, and dyed-in-the-wool corrupt politicians? You can get Amazon to force their workers to go to Robin DiAngelos hate-filled ""White Fragility"" seminars, but you can't get them to let their workers have a union? You can get massive Hollywood studios to discriminate against employing white people even in minor roles like technicians and stage laborers, but you can't get them to lobby behind health care?

Does it occur to you that the rich will always want SOME group of poor people that will be desperate enough to work for less than a living wage?

&gt; Abolishing these wouldn't just benefit minorities, they'd benefit everyone.

Look, you seem like a good person, but doing what you're suggesting is not going to help anybody from the standpoint of CRT.

Take police brutality. Police commit violence against black people at a disproportionate rate. This can be verified by DOJ statistics. Black people have a disproportionately high crime rate. This can be verified by DOJ statistics. The increased incidence of violence *is proportional* to the increased crime rate.

So, let's say your job is to fix this. You're given power to make new policies that address the situation. You've got great ideas, de-escalation training, community involvement, finding every Dave Grossman book and throwing them into a pulp shredder, things that are going to lower the police violence rate for *everybody*.

...

But then, when the police use these new de-escalation techniques on white people as well as black people...the high black crime rate still leads to a high police violence against black people rate.

Don't you get it? In order to make a racially specific change, you need a racially specific policy! You'd have to somehow mandate that police use these great new techniques to lower their violence rate against black people without doing the same to white people, or the imbalance will persist!

When you peg black progress to white people, you create this perverse incentive to see white failure and white poverty and white misery as something that's helping you achieve your goal! It's not enough to simply move black people forward, you have to hold white people back, or you never close the gap!

CRT villifies white people because CRT creates the context to *emotionally* excuse the actions you *must* take to advance one race you like relative to another race you don't.",1609888511.0,-1

Tesla Motors is where most of the wealth is coming from and it is most definitely ""viable"".",1610042427.0,1
"To say that Amazon hasn't done anything besides ripping off competitors and producing 'Amazon Basic' garbage is extremely ignorant. The main advancements to technology that Amazon has brought on have been in the cloud computing space (AWS) and in Amazon's supply chain. You realize 2-day shipping anywhere in the country did not and could not exist before Amazon, right? I'm also a big fan of Tesla's missions but Amazon has arguably already changed the world in the two sectors I mentioned.",1610042519.0,1
"you know.. that's what people said about amazon (every brick and mortar will just create their own online shopping site), that's what people said about google (any company can develop a search algo and unseat google as fast as they unseated yahoo), people said that about apple (nokia, motorola, etc.. will be make their own smartphones), and netflix (all the networks and studios will make their own streaming sites), and facebook (twitter, google plus, instagram, or some other social network will displace fb like they did to myspace).. 

the thing is, once companies like this get on that rocket ship and blast off, try as they might it becomes impossible to catch up to them. yeah toyota can build it's own rocket, but it won't be more powerful than tesla's and it'll have taken off 5 years later. it's really really really hard to knock a market leader/innovator off their throne, tesla is part of the zeitgeist, no car company has ever been more relevant, it is sought after the world over.. no one thinks of a toyota the way they do a tesla. it's like comparing the original iphone to the nokia brick. one is the future, one is the past. 

based on tesla's valuations, they could issue stock/debt at insane levels and basically buy up any competing company they want, or scoop up any innovative startup much like google buying youtube/android or facebook buying whatsapp/insta.. they just keep scooping up the next best thing, no one else has a chance.",1610042621.0,1

"I understand that. What I'm saying is Tesla has their cars, you can throw self driving AI in there too. Amazon has their fingers in many vastly different industries.

In DIRECT impact, selling 3 billions in december made Amazon stock go down by 5%. In indirect impact it does less impact, has since the last time he sold stock before that, his stock value increased by much more than 3 billions.

Selling from time to time doesn't send a message. Selling massively your stock does.

We should be promoting financial literacy, not whining/complaining because some people make more intelligent decisions with their finances. And others can't be bothered to learn how investing works.

If investing wasn't lucrative at all, we wouldn't have Apple, Google, Tesla or Amazon. We wouldn't have self-driving cars, 1 day shipping, iPhones and so on. America wouldn't be the leaders in technological innovation. At that point we might as well just lay down and let China take over everything.",1610043701.0,1

"I mean to be fair bezos sold 10billion dollars of amazon stock this year and amazon still has quite a high stock value. Sure, selling all of his stock would probably lower the stock price, but for these super rich, just selling a tiny amount of it already means they have made more money than many people will make in their lifetime.

Honest question here... We know Amazon and Bezos do everything they can to avoid paying taxes.  Does Elon do the same?   I'd assume so but never heard anything about it.,1610044631.0,1
Seems weird to not just simply label them as a car company when cars make up the vast majority of their business and why people use the company. Like Amazon is funding drone technology but we don’t focus on that when describing them.,1610044737.0,1
Yeah all billionaires get the block and Amazon should be nationalised everywhere,1610044882.0,0
Amazon also had a PE ratio of 3633.14 in Q3 of 2012: by itself the number doesn't mean much.,1610044916.0,1

I just gotta photoshop the gold dragon bezos of amazon into a car that shoots out money through its headlights,1610045046.0,1
It doesn't seem weird at all. They are expanding into various renewable ventures with huge growth potential and access to cheap funding.  Amazon started out as a book retailer and tesla started out as a car company and Tesla is poised to become much more than that just like Amazon did. The stock price is counting on that potential.,1610045047.0,1

Personal income tax yes business taxes probably not like amazon they are tax exempt.,1610045283.0,1
I love how wage slaves keep defending the notion that somehow these people are not obscenely rich because their compensation is primarily in shares. Jeff Bezos sold over $10 billion in Amazon shares in 2020 alone. The sales occur in prearranged trading plans that eliminate any surprise from the market and are a perfectly safe way to convert shares to absurd income levels.,1610045338.0,1
I literally can't find a single popular company with a PE ratio below 30. Amazon is almost 100.,1610045403.0,1
"Well those people would be correct. When he sold those shares the Amazon board is notified and buyers are found before any shares are sold. It is the farthest thing from ""the drop of a hat"". Often hedge funds and large investment firms are made aware of this and they'll buy many of the stocks directly or find buyers for the stocks at current market valuation prior to him selling. This ensures Bezos isn't unloading a massive amount of shares into an open market which would heavily affect the company's valuation as well as the rest of the shareholders stake.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind, even when he does liquidate his stocks it is not simply withdrawing money. He is exchanging his shares of his highly sought after company for liquid cash. He is losing ownership of the company he built when he does this. Whether or not the company is built on underpaid workers is irrelevant to the conversation.",1610045430.0,1
"Amazon never had high net profits, but still had huge, rapidly growing revenues during it's peak P/E ratio times. They also had a huge, rapidly growing cash cow in AWS to bank roll the rest of their growth. Tesla is just making cars right now and the price is a speculation that in the future, it will basically dominate, not the market of selling cars, but instead the entire transportation industry. I honestly don't know how the market is that confident that a company with only 500k annual sales can get to that point in the near future. Like why tf that's priced in completely at this stage is so confusing. Sure it can happen, but I wouldn't price Tesla at it's current evaluation right now. That's why I will never put in a sizable amount of money in Tesla. It's beyond my head even if I'm missing out on potential gains",1610045580.0,1
"I would say its more of a tech company than a car company. Comparing it to the T’s that Apple, MS, Amazon, and Google makes 800B seem small.",1610045628.0,1
"That’s a weak example when Tesla’s profits are almost entirely dependent on selling carbon credits. Meanwhile Amazon was making gains in the extremely high margin cloud computing industry.

Here’s another way to look at it: Tesla’s price to sales ratio is over 25 now. Amazon has never been above 5 (at least over the last 14 years of data I checked).",1610045783.0,1
"I lack the proper business knowledge to describe this... but Amazon actually did stuff and sold stuff and did good business things. Also that 3500 p/e lined up with when their EPS had a pretty big dip (wtf happened in 2012/2013?). 

Tesla’s crazy p/e basically came as soon as they make a profit (cyber truck deposits?) and after they’ve basically done no real innovation and nothing new. Yes they were sort of first to market, but only sort of. Electric cars aren’t new, lithium batteries aren’t new, Tesla’s batteries aren’t any better (just more of them), fast charging is NOT unique to Tesla, etc. It was cool to root for the underdog for a while but the big car manufacturers will probably demolish Tesla within 5 years. Might see Tesla pivot to manufacturing batteries for other manufacturers and that would allow them to survive and keep making cars, but that’s a maybe. 

I’m no expert though so whatever. I just see Elon Musk as being 50% snake oil salesman and 40% someone who takes other people’s ideas and claims them as his own as if he reinvented the wheel.",1610045902.0,1
"It has flaws but the fundamental fact is Bezos can take a week off and the company will still function. Maybe a little aimlessly, but it'll function.

If the thousands of front line amazon workers walk off the job, the company shuts down. The working class, if they realized it, could single handedly run amazon into the ground or make it succeed. They should ask for more.",1610045995.0,1
"&gt; in 2007 nokia sold 435 million phones, apple sold 1.9 million.

In 2007 Nokia valuation was 150 billions. That same year Apple peaked at 170 billions and was in more market than Nokia. Apple was in the luxury market too, with margin much higher than Nokia.

Yup theses figures made much more sense than Tesla figure right now.

&gt; amazon's revenue won't be going down after covid.

1.77x? Seriously? I'm wasting my time with you.

The people you talk about were already on Amazon. It's not a new player, they had 200 millions unique user a month before Covid in the US. They were already using it. What made them use it more wasn't that it was a better alternative, they were already using it for what it was better in. During Covid people used it more (I would be amazed if that's 1.77x more), but only because it was a better alternative DURING covid, not because they were offering something they didn't before.",1610046198.0,1

you're absolutely wrong, amazon revenues are not going to drop a dime after all is said and done. their moat just grew wider this year.. so many big retailers are on the verge of bankruptcy, they couldn't compete with amazon on shipping before and now they don't have a fucking chance.",1610046553.0,1

I know plenty of people that said the same and no longer are on Amazon Prime.

If you order enough, it make sense, but after the pandemy, you won't... 

&gt; they couldn't compete with amazon on shipping

Seriously losing my time here. Shipping? We are talking about the pandemy. They haven't stole customer from other online platform (well I'm sure they got a few, but that's a tiny part) because theses platforms were still open, they stole them from physical places. Yeah they won't compete with their shipping... they are in that sphere at all.",1610046896.0,1

"during the dot com bubble amazon had a p/e more than double tesla's current insane p/e ratio. to be fair the stock crashed from $100 to $20, but much of that was due to the larger dotcom crash. if tesla crashes 50% off it's $4,000 pre split price i'd be shocked. would still leave it up something like 500% from it's march lows.",1610047149.0,-1
"Maybe.


Amazon that kinda made sense. It's a lot easier to grow an ""anyone can sell anything here"" online store and the same goes for AWS. Both of those had potential expansion up to a huge chunk of all online shopping and server rentals. Both of those had and continue to have huge leads over competitors in all kinds of important things.



Tesla doesn't. They still have massive quality control issues, the csrs are missing a lot of features found in other cars at the same price point (even electric ones), and their main advantage at this point is basically hype, being first, range, and a better charging station network. Other automakers building out a charging network is a work in progress and they will catch up. Other automakers have better QC. Other automakers don't meet Tesla's range because they're selling cheaper cars and batteries cost a lot.",1610047206.0,1
People also tend to ignore real wages when they realize it undermines their own argument. How many more times do I need to see “Amazon underpays!” on this website when they self-enforce a minimum wage that’s over double the federal minimum and higher than every state in the country..,1610047274.0,-1
"You’re right they’re not the same, Amazon operates a higher margin business lol. EV credits are not going away but they also won’t scale up with sales, other autos won’t be buying them once they are offering their own EVs to reap their share of the credits. It’s already starting to happen: Norway, one of the only countries with majority EV sales as a percentage of mew vehicles has Volkswagen as the top EV seller, not Tesla. 

For Tesla to justify its valuation it needs to break into completely different industries, or vastly ramp up the base profitability of its vehicles. Neither seems likely to me as they still have to spend a ton of money just to get to either of those places, and with no guarantee it will even be successful.",1610047578.0,1

You’re thinking of perfect compensation which is not the case. Nba players like Lebron can bring in millions (worth $500 million to Cleveland) but he won’t be compensated that much. Music idols that bring in money for their country economy don’t get the extra money too.

Striking is fine but ""stopping scab workers"" is obviously an illegal (for good reason) and immoral violation of the non-agression principle.  One might also ""run amazon into the ground"" by say sabotaging their delivery trucks or somehow hacking into their website and taking it down.

Someone else defended Tesla valuation saying that because Uber won't make self driving taxi finally, that this valuation moved to Tesla, failling to accounting that Uber current valuation is higher than when they announced they would abandon developping self driving taxi.

We will see in 2022. I feel pretty safe to say that if we project their revenue based on their history up to the end of 2019, and project that up to 2023, it will be pretty close to what will happens in reality.

How irrational can you be to put that against Amazon? They didn't push other cloud computing platforms out of business, they pioneered the entire industry. You wouldn't be writing Reddit comments today if Bezos didn't pour his/his companies billions into that infrastructure, doing it successfully and thus convincing Microsoft, Google and IBM to do the same a couple years later.

You think e.g. 2010 Reddit had the cash to build and maintain their own servers? The accessibility that AWS and later competitors provide not for the end user, but the ones trying to establish new products is invaluable. Without Amazon leading the charge on affordable cloud options like that every new idea would turn out like YouTube: people get interested, traffic goes up, website owners run out of money to support the site, gotta sell it off to someone who is already sitting on either infrastructure and money, or both.

Look at Twitter, yeah, by 2010 they got their hands on enough cash to build their own infrastructure, but they would have never gotten off the ground without third party services. Same for Spotify or Instagram or a majority of all other startups, apps or websites made in the last 10+ years.

So really only the people who were there from the beginning are getting those benefits. 

Also something that isn’t mentioned here is part of why Tesla is valued so highly is they finally made a profit in Q2 2020. That profit is due in large part to pay cuts. So yeah that employee who just had their pay cut at the start of a pandemic has to just hope they make it there long enough to get it to vest and to that the stock price keeps going up. 

Amazon has done the same thing for years too. They reward their engineers with stock options that vest in 3 years and a lot of people can’t even make it that long cause they’re over worked and the rest of the compensation is not great. At least for Amazon the pay is nice.

You stated the company is being ""forced"" to pay more. While I am certainly happy to force them to through workers seizing the company and bringing the means of production under democratic control, it's also not what I'm staying here.

The point I'm making is that Bezos is not forced to pay. The workers use their leverage to extract a better deal for themselves, which both parties would agree to in the form of a union contract. The workers aren't emptying the bank account of Amazon, they are meeting them at the bargaining table.

From my position, you seem to be purposefully misrepresenting and misunderstanding my positions in bad faith, and that's not productive or helpful. I don't think you're arguing in good faith here.

What in actually saying is that according out you, it is OK to limit someone's freedoms if doing so prevents harm. So, I needed to prove harm. Which I did. Scab workers fundamentally weaken the bargaining position of striking workers. They are reducing the leverage those striking workers have to extract concessions from their employer, resulting in worse deals for the workers.

If you'd like to see this in action, the US' constant erosion of workers rights and the aftermath of the very judgment you brought up is reason enough. Strike breaking is way easier now resulting in shittier deals. The practice of scabbing in general thus harms the striking workers.

Now, scab work In general, it's very existence, harms the position of all workers. Unions will be reluctant to strike because scabs can ruin their position. Thus it damages the whole working class, which includes the scab workers.

Now, I'm going to stop responding. I think you're arguing in bad faith in this thread. For what it's worth I don't think you're a thug or anything. You've insulted me a bunch, but I think it's mainly because confronting the shitty system we have now is a tough thing to do. It's a fault of your upbringing and the culture we are in.

Bezos is not making $4.5m/hour. He's not getting that deposited in his bank account somewhere. He owns stock, and has since the founding of Amazon, whose value has gone up. That's a completely different proposition than a wage. Linking wages to the value of an asset is not relevant.

*****
&gt; Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is no longer the richest man in the world, after Tesla CEO Elon Musk&amp;#039;s fortune on Thursday rose to $188.5 billion, $1.5 billion more than Bezos.

&gt; Shares in electric carmaker Tesla rose by more than 6 percent on Thursday to push South African-born Musk into the top spot, dethroning Bezos from the place he has occupied for more than three years, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

&gt; Musk&amp;#039;s personal fortune, which is tied to Tesla&amp;#039;s share price, rose by more than $150 billion last year.

"Basically, the way it works here is that we hate the richest people in the world but it has to be the big name ones because that shit is low hanging fruit. We would never go after any of the no name people since those don't get upvotes. Also Bill Gates is exempt from this hate. We get on our knees for Gates because he does the Reddit gift exchange and is considered one of us because of AMAs. Once in a while we will post that video of him jumping over a chair and laugh about it. How quirky! We also don't talk about Warren Buffet either since no one really understands how the fuck he does it. 

But seriously, don't take this site as a serious indicator of how the real world views these people. This place is littered with broke ass people with extremely limited knowledge of business and finance. They just see that there are rich people and there are poor people and somehow everything would be better if the rich were less rich or eliminated. As if the poor would automatically have that wealth transferred to them tomorrow if all the billionaires were gone. Somehow the middle class is completely ignored. Was it a record growth in the stock market in 2020 while there was a global pandemic? Sure there was, but lets not pretend that a whole lot of middle class people didn't benefit a whole lot either. They might not have millions in investments, but you can bet those who are financially savvy saw some really nice returns, even if its just investing in index funds.

Look at the number of Amazon trucks on the roads, most people don't have a problem with Amazon or Bezos. I'm sure the Walton family would happily take on the hate that Bezos gets today (they probably did back before Amazon was around), if they can get all that market share back that they lost to Amazon.",1610068471.0,1
"&gt; The point I'm making is that Bezos is not forced to pay. The workers use their leverage to extract a better deal for themselves, which both parties would agree to in the form of a union contract. The workers aren't emptying the bank account of Amazon, they are meeting them at the bargaining table.

Right...yeah just confused why you're using the present tense to describe your fantasy scenario that has not happened and is not happening.  Bezos is not under any obligation to honor a hypothetical contract that he **has not signed**.  You need to snap back to reality lol.

&gt; and that's not productive or helpful.

A contract killing is the one example you have used to justify using force against Bezos and his replacement worker to prevent them from transacting with each other.  It's a ludicrous comparison and you deserve the mockery for making it.

And I'd say repeatedly falsely claiming that you have proved your assertions when you have not provided any..you know...proof...is more of an unproductive activity.

&gt; So, I needed to prove harm. Which I did.

Again, no you didn't.  You asserted/claimed that harm was being done to a 3rd party. You did not provide any evidence, data, or facts to support your claim.  Repeating a claim is not proving it.

&gt; the US' constant erosion of workers rights and the aftermath of the very judgment you brought up is reason enough.

This is the closest you've coming to substantiating actual proof (still pretty far away).  It seems pretty inarguable that economic outcomes are generally much better now than they were before 1938 (of course there are many reasons for that).  US citizens enjoy more economic freedom than pretty much any other country and the USA has emerged to dominate the global economy since that time.

&gt; For what it's worth I don't think you're a thug or anything. You've insulted me a bunch, but I think it's mainly because confronting the shitty system we have now is a tough thing to do

"The problem with this idea is that a business has to be able to define where the line is for an individual worker’s responsibility and their sole contribution to the company. Their compensation is determined by those factors.

A warehouse worker shouldn’t be rewarded because a software engineer optimized the routing algorithm. That’s the problem with viewing the entire workforce as one collective, especially in a company like Amazon where you have vastly different calibers of workers, from MIT PhD Computer Scientists to Jethro from Kentucky who is on house arrest.

For every product sold and shipped by Amazon, there is finite revenue that is distributed across the organization. What a warehouse worker contributes to that process of selling and shipping is percentages of percentage points in the total cost that it took to make that sale and deliver the product.

For the record, Amazon’s value is based on its logistics and scalable web service, not shipping or warehouses. All of the valuable things in the company were designed by some of the worlds smartest and most talented software engineers. They are compensated very well and I have a few colleagues at Amazon who have turned into multi millionaires in the past year due to the stock appreciation.

The warehouses are a necessary annoyance to a much larger and much more valuable and complex operation that is happening behind the scenes. It doesn’t make them the primary profit generating unit in the company.",1610084616.0,1

Or just weather satellites to tell us about tomorrow’s weather? SpaceX is making all that possible and much much more. Blue Origin will be doing that too and competing with SpaceX to make things even cheaper.  The space program is vital.

&gt;	14 makes it sound real nice when they pitch 16 an hour which is no where near worth how much Amazon got paid from the govt.

Amazon pays warehouse employees above national average. If they worked for smaller companies they’d be paid less.

When did Amazon get paid by the government?

&gt;	we wouldn’t be twiddling our thumbs with the time we deserve we would again work another shift to double our bag or go to take a course or spend quality time with your kids which makes everyone happy. 

Americans now spend more time with family than at any other point in history. And during Covid that has quadrupled. Abuse, suicide, depression, anxiety, and divorce have shot up dramatically. We don’t need more time together. People need to get out and work and be productive, not spend more time with family.

&gt;	No my friend these aren’t property bubbles it is in fact hyper inflation it is happening as we speak. 

I’ll stick with the experts on this one. The dollar is holding its value at the moment, and if we were in hyperinflation it wouldn’t be. we may be on the brink, but we aren’t there yet.

&gt;	 Bro humans are marking up property left and right properties that aren’t worth what they are saying it is I mean look around? Same house cost 40k to build same wood same material nowadays 240k. 

I am househunting at the moment and I don’t think I’ve ever seen a house in the last 20 years cost only $40,000 to build. Unless it was a tiny one bedroom mini home. Sure, some property is overpriced but the market will adjust. in my area houses are priced pretty good.


&gt;	Cost of living goes up on my child support yet we don’t get a raise on our minimum wage or wage in general when cost of living goes up??? I know that for a fact. What’s your excuse on that ?

Cost-of-living rises partly because the government keeps printing money with no real property value attached to it. If the government stop doing that the dollar would rise in buying power. We could just go back to the gold standard, but then we couldn’t print unlimited sums of money.

If Amazon is forced to pay higher taxes they may no longer be able to undercut the competition and may also start charging $5 for a widget.

He starts taking his family out to dinner more often, shops more at other local businesses, and he needs to hire 3 or 4 more local employees to handle the increased business. That money is all staying in a local community instead of being gobbled up by Amazon where it won't be churned over and over again.

Obviously, this is a very utopian view of how things could change. But, there's a reason that small businesses are being destroyed by the Amazons and Wal Marts of the world.

"While this is fair that's not really how it works. When you take on one giant you take them all on for one thing. If Apple didn't get some attention or treatment of it being a monopoly it would then be the monopoly in that same regard. Not busting them up is how you turn a ""quaint"" business model into a bad one. Plenty of this can be seen in history. A few guys take the hit and then the one that doesn't becomes the bad guy after the fact.

It should be known Apple has also been caught collecting data through Siri without letting it's users know until it was caught. While that might not fair by comparison it means that Apple is not as above breaking the rules if it keeps it relevant. You never want to have one company not realizing it isn't above getting some form of punishment either. I wouldn't want anyone to just own the market or be the only company standing. Not Google or Apple or Amazon etc. Because all of them, regardless business model, care about one thing, money.

Apple also isn't and hasn't been the good guys lately. Partnering with people that have been using child labor and their lobbying against a bill that fights against forced labor. I don't think you can truly trust any of them. Apple wants to make it's devices the singular device. I don't want to imagine a world in which the only thing people use is an iPhone because then Apple doesn't have to change and can still charge an ungodly price. This goes with search engines and cars. I don't want Google to be the only primary search engine but Apple caught wind of the anti-trust suits and are rumored to now be making their own search engine. Which makes sense but why now? Apple made their own login options on sites like Reddit or battlenet so they don't care to make things and deploy them. The timing is what throws me off about Apple. Why haven't they made a search engine anyways to compete with Google? Why wait until Google is feeling the anti trust law suits. Because money. I don't think it's because Apple doesn't care about privacy but it's because Apple sees that they can now be the one search engine to dominate the market if Google's goes away.

This is of course my opinion. But I don't trust Apple either. Apple talks about supporting all of these smaller app developers and businesses but do you think Apple is going to let DuckDuckGo be the search engine if Google falls short?

"&gt; This is an unpopular opinion but whatever would result from splitting up the big tech companies would almost certainly be worse for customers than what they are now.

There is zero doubt in the short term.  I believe it would also be true in the long term but the longer term is at least debatable.  But there is ZERO question in the short term it would be a lot worse for the consumer.

A big reason I do NOT believe it will happen.

Totally agree about Amazon.  It is the vertical integration on why they can lower operating cost.

I personally can't stand the iPhone model, but I acknowledge that they play to a certain market and don't see any kind of monopolistic practice here.

"I've never understood this, because monopoly power is owning the entire means of production, allowing you to shut others out. Amazon is one thing, but like Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.

While I guess you could argue a server and the software that makes up a social media platform is the entire means of production, and thus technically, they own the entire means of production - how do you go about splitting up a ""monopoly"" formed by customer choice in the first place?

Lets take Facebook. They do this and now we have Facebook 1 and Facebook 2. So then one of a few things could happen.

IF everyone signs up with Facebook 1 or Facebook 2 exclusively, then suddenly, the one people used is once again a monopoly that needs to be split up.

Or, some people choose Facebook 1 and some choose Facebook 2. But oh no! I signed up for Facebook 1 and my grandmother is on Facebook 2. But I want to interact with my grandmother on Facebook so... I also make a Facebook 2. A large number of users will also find themselves in a situation where they now have Facebook 1 and Facebook 2 accounts, meaning they just have to split between apps to do what they do with one now.

Then both Facebook 1 and 2, basically sharing all of it's users, are once again a monopoly each in their own right.

But you are saying it is a harmful monopoly and I'm wondering how you see a restructuring or a breakup or simply what world can you imagine where your perceived harm would be eliminated? You say there is harm being done, which would imply the natural state of affairs there would be no harm. My claim is that warehouse jobs just naturally suck and have high turnover. That if there was no Amazon those kinds of jobs would suck just as much, if not worse(because now the companies everyone works for is going to cut more corners and have less money) and they'll be paid less.

Racism is a powerful word, antiracism is a civic religion, corporations are incredible at understanding what people’s beliefs are and how to use them, and people are really angry and want to pretend there’s something easy that can be done when in reality our problems have nothing to do with “too much” speech and everything to do with material conditions and our moribund political structures.

In older industries you were breaking up physical assets, an oil company could be broken down into smaller oil companies, but that doesnt work with internet based companies. Everything is intertwined now and relies on different pieces of itself to function. Google for example has a monopoly on search but it's a user created monopoly. It has a monopoly because people use it, people dont use it because it has a monopoly. You can't break google search into ""google"" and ""google 2"" since it's based on consumer habits. Most of these businesses run a non-profitable arm subsidized by their profitable side so if they were to be broken up we might lose some valuable services. Amazon I could see being broken into amazon shopping, AWS, whole foods, and media. Facebook could maybe split into its individual platforms.

This is not that. This is old world business exerting influence and money to get lawmakers and politicians to hurt new world businesses. 

ISP's literally took government money in a promise to up their infrastructure and just said nope. AND KEPT THE MONEY. All around the country people only have a single option to choose from. In some cases there are 2, wooooo.

These companies have fought local municipalities creating their own broadband services. They literally fought and made promises to cities who just said screw it we will do it ourselves. Spoilers the cities that have are better for it. 

These companies have spent decades using unfair business tactics to keep their shares of the pie clear of outsiders. And have not been touched for it. 

As far as google, apple, and amazon go. Sure I am not ok with some of googles practices say when it comes to the money spent to keep its browser number one on phones. Or how Amazon treats its employees in some circumstances.

However, that is not where this pressure it coming from. It's coming from the businesses that used to operate that are being hurt. Look at the outrage from the likes of CVS and Walmart when Amazon announced its prescription program. 

I'm sorry but Walmart crying foul about another business coming in and stealing their customers is some giant karmic joke. And I for one think people everywhere being able to get cheaper prescriptions faster, without having to get themselves to a pharmacy is a great thing. Specially with the drug prices in this country.

"So let's say you split Amazon in half.

First off, how? Two smaller amazons that sell all the same stuff? Are you restricting one to ONLY selling some types of goods, and the other can ONLY sell other types of goods?

If they sell the same stuff, I'm simply going to latch onto whichever one has slightly lower prices, as will virtually 100-percent of the rest of the market. Whichever of the two has a  larger market share will have lower overheads as a result (mass-shipping and packaging reduces your costs), and the smaller of the two will shrivel up and die, so we're just back to square one.

If they sell separate goods, then they are still monopolies for their individual sectors.

The whole point of Amazon is that it's a single site that I can go to and find everything I need. That is *literally* the appeal/point of the website.

It's the same reason people are starting to go back to pirating movies and TV - Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Apple, etc are all competing, and I don't want to have to pay $20-30/month to 4-6 different companies, so I pirate stuff again. The whole reason I left cable was $100/month is absolutely insane, ESPECIALLY when I have to sit through your fucking ads.

"I invite you all to read why breaking up (some) of these companies is not a good idea: https://stratechery.com/2019/where-warrens-wrong/

The crux (from what I understand): Companies should not be punished for providing a better user experience. Google is providing you everything for free, and the fact that everything is tied together makes so many things so much easier. Imagine trying to start a blog or an online business without Facebook or Google (so, so many companies &amp; industries wouldn't exist without these companies). If it wasn't for social media platforms, we wouldn't have heard from the doctors in Wuhan. I could go on and on, and so could you. 
The problem isn't that some of these companies are bad actors, the ""problem"" is that they're too powerful and we don't like it.

That's not to say these companies shouldn't be regulated. These companies all have problems: 
In case of Facebook, it's the acquisitions of Instagram &amp; WhatsApp.
In case of Google, it's the acquisition of DoubleClick (Google's biggest advertising competitor at the time). Both of these have given Facebook &amp; Google a duopoly on advertising. 
In case of Apple, it's the monopoly on App &amp; in-app purchases along with a 30% cut. They genuinely provide a good user experience by standardising the payment and making it more secure. At the same time, they don't allow apps to link to websites where the same digital products can be brought, bypassing their cut. They also don't allow you to price your digital goods differently than other platforms, screwing developers. (Side note: I think shitty practices like these will ultimately cause Apple's downfall)
I don't know enough to say anything concrete about Amazon. Some of their business practices &amp; ethics are incredibly shady tho.

You can't realistically divide any of these companies up. The acquisitions of Facebook &amp; Google were the failure of regulators. You can't simply undo 10 year old acquisitions. Again, that's not to say that there isn't a problem with having so big companies have so much control. But we need to regulate them properly. Breaking them up will be devastating in the short term &amp; more than likely to stave off significant investments into technology in the long run.

My understanding is crude and my explanations are even cruder. You should definitely read the article(s).",1610225831.0,-1

Most of these are natural monopolies and splitting them up would stifle growth, innovation, and would be worse for consumer. (And before I begin no I’m not an anarcho-capitalist. I’m actually progressive by American standards, and center by European standards, think Elizabeth Warren policies.

First off these corporation are monopolies for two reasons. The first reason is that consumers and humans are lazy and always will be. No one wants to go to ten different shopping sites to try to find a product, people just want to go on Amazon and buy what they are looking for. So break them up now and consumers will just pick one and that one will become a monopoly in a decade. Second they are natural monopolies because to be able to offer so many services, for such a low price, with most of the services being free then corporations first need to reach a critical mass of money and infrastructure to offer all these services. I know they data mine, but that doesn’t cost the consumer any money, and guess what consumers at this current moment value their wallet over their privacy, and that’s probably for the best because we can either have personalized ads or have lower socioeconomic statuses be blocked off from internet services. Getting back on the main subject they are able to offer these immense services for so little to almost every segment of the population because they are monopolies, smaller chunks would not be able to that. Also smaller chunks would not have to money and resources to push technology forward at the incredible rate it’s going today.

"E-commerce is generally more concentrated than the offline retail world. This means that Amazon's position is more dominant than the big offline retailers, especially in certain market segments, which gives them more ability to abuse their power. 

I would also argue that Amazon has more control over its ""storefront"" than an offline retailer. There is only so much you can do with the physical world. Having prime shelf space is really the same as being the first result versus being on page 10. 

Similarly, a regular retailer won't generate the same rich data that online retailers can (customers browsing and purchases are much less traceable offline etc). Amazon are in a much better position to leverage the data created by its sellers to pick out winners. The only question being, should they really get access to that data. Because the end result is they get far better data than anyone else in the market, because they don't just collect it from their own products but also from across the market and from their role as an interface (i.e, getting access to data on elements such as ad spend).

Amazon's position puts them in a position to roll out private label brands much more effectively than a typical offline retailer, which would generally have to wait until those brands are well established already.

No they don't. They don't even have a market majority. What they have is a captive audience for people looking to buy/make apps for iOS. Which is like, 30% of the smartphone market.

Android, Google Play Store and Amazon App Store all say otherwise.

"No. I think Amazon hosts around 40% of the traffic on the web, very close to the 50% hard stop on being a monopoly. 

Amazon also will use data from their platform to take out competition in their manufacturing arm. Like they will buy the product from the competitors manufacturer, buyout the whole manufacturer depending and list their product for cheaper and display it first. 

Also I’m not a lawyer and unlike most plebbitors I’ll say I don’t even think it’s specifically because they fit the definition of monopolies they have trust/cartel(?) issues. 

For google and Apple perhaps the issue is they use their market control to impact markets they aren’t in purely for ideological reasons eg you can’t actually have unmoderated free speech platforms. Last I check google+ is dead and Apple never really did social media so why would they be able to arbitrarily throw their weight around? 

The ideological belief of a company or even companies in a particular market shouldn’t be able to destroy competitors in markets they have 0 stake in. 

To put it into extremes, all oil and gas companies can come together and decide they really hate pizza, now suddenly  pizza shops can’t run because no company will provide the gas for the ovens. 

People like referencing the bake the cake bigot shit you may or may not know of. Essentially a Christian baker, who was dead serious about his beliefs didn’t even make halloween cakes, refused to decorate a gay wedding cake. What’s funny is the merits of that case never got debated, it got tossed out due to extreme bias from the human rights commission directed towards the baker. Essentially if they didn’t belittle and mock his faith, and maybe if the gay couple didn’t target this baker just to have a lawsuit, scotus would have to seriously debate whether this mans freedom to choose his customers impacts the ability for a gay couple to have their wedding. It’s always a compromise and it’s not a one and done now we got precedent. Things like, is there another baker available at around the same price. If there is it’s foolish to weigh in their favor, if there isn’t then the court absolutely has to weigh in their favor because the discrimination is leading towards damages. 

Again not a lawyer that’s just what I’ve read and what makes sense to me. My jargon and citation of trust laws is prolly off.

"Amazon's [Letter](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/amazon-parler-aws) to Parler's Chief Policy Officer Amy Peikoff

&gt;Dear Amy,  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for speaking with us earlier today.  
&gt;  
&gt;As we discussed on the phone yesterday and this morning, we remain troubled by the repeated violations of our terms of service. Over the past several weeks, we’ve reported 98 examples to Parler of posts that clearly encourage and incite violence. Here are a few examples below from the ones we’ve sent previously: \[See images above.\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Recently, we’ve seen a steady increase in this violent content on your website, all of which violates our terms. It’s clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service. It also seems that Parler is still trying to determine its position on content moderation. You remove some violent content when contacted by us or others, but not always with urgency. Your CEO recently stated publicly that he doesn’t “feel responsible for any of this, and neither should the platform.” This morning, you shared that you have a plan to more proactively moderate violent content, but plan to do so manually with volunteers. It’s our view that this nascent plan to use volunteers to promptly identify and remove dangerous content will not work in light of the rapidly growing number of violent posts. This is further demonstrated by the fact that you still have not taken down much of the content that we’ve sent you. Given the unfortunate events that transpired this past week in Washington, D.C., there is serious risk that this type of content will further incite violence.  
&gt;  
&gt;AWS provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we continue to respect Parler’s right to determine for itself what content it will allow on its site. However, we cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others. **Because Parler cannot comply with our terms of service and poses a very real risk to public safety, we plan to suspend Parler’s account effective Sunday, January 10th, at 11:59PM PST.** We will ensure that all of your data is preserved for you to migrate to your own servers, and will work with you as best as we can to help your migration.

&gt; Amazon on Saturday kicked Parler off its Web hosting services.

&gt; In an email obtained by BuzzFeed News, an Amazon Web Services Trust and Safety team told Parler Chief Policy Officer Amy Peikoff that the calls for violence propagating across Parler violated its terms of service and that Amazon is unconvinced that the service&amp;#039;s plan to use volunteers to moderate such things will be effective.

&gt; &amp;quot;Because Parler cannot comply with our terms of service and poses a very real risk to public safety, we plan to suspend Parler&amp;#039;s account effective Sunday, January 10th, at 11:59PM PST.&amp;quot;.

I mean, when moderates and progressives are pushing private companies to do so, eh, I dunno. And yes, part of that is ""we will be driven away from your platform otherwise"".

The moderates and progressives at Amazon are doing this. It isn't a function of the company itself, but the individuals within it.

I don't think Parler is being threatened with extra fines or such here.

3. Avoid wallowing in misinformation and scare tactics

Somehow people can’t make the connection between people committing giant newsworthy crimes that the vast majority of the country finds reprehensible and private companies banning people for business reasons. Seems to me that the people banned from Twitter were connected to that crime, the services deplatformed were used for the planning or glorification of that crime. It’s pretty simple, don’t make national news and force Twitter/Amazon/etc hands and you’ll probably be fine for a long time. If “big tech” is actually some sort of liberal tool than they’re pretty bad ones considering how successfully it’s all been used by conservatives for the past 4 years.

"Most social media companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit have moderators or ways to flag content that is promoting violence.  Parler is toted as a social media platform that does not have this type of moderation.  After the violence on the Capital building Google, Apple, and now Amazon have opted to ban Parler because it was used to plan and facilitate the mass riot.  For example Apple released a statement saying:

“We require your immediate attention regarding serious App Store guideline violations that we have found with your app, Parler,” Apple’s letter says. “We have received numerous complaints regarding objectionable content in your Parler service, accusations that the Parler app was used to plan, coordinate, and facilitate the illegal activities in Washington D.C. on January 6, 2021 that led (among other things) to loss of life, numerous injuries, and the destruction of property. The app also appears to continue to be used to plan and facilitate yet further illegal and dangerous activities.”  [(source link)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2021/01/08/apple-warns-parler-of-imminent-ban-due-to-serious-app-store-guideline-violations/?sh=104958066823)

In short, due to the Trump’s recent rhetoric, a large number of media companies are stepping up to either remove flagrant falsehoods or any messages that may incite further violence.  Free speech is only protected in the USA if it does not promote a “true threat”.

&gt; Amazon&amp;#039;s cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services, informed Parler on Saturday that it will no longer provide cloud services to the company beginning on Sunday at 11:59 p.m. PT, according to an email obtained by CNBC. AWS provides cloud services to Parler that host its website, which means that if Parler can&amp;#039;t locate a new cloud provider by Sunday night, the site will go offline for its users.

&gt; In the email, Amazon Web Services&amp;#039; Trust and Safety team told Parler&amp;#039;s Chief Policy Officer Amy Peikoff that the platform continues to host &amp;quot;Violent content&amp;quot; that violates AWS&amp;#039; terms of service.

&gt; AWS told Parler in the email that it had flagged 98 examples to Parler of posts that &amp;quot;Clearly encourage and incite violence.&amp;quot; Among the posts it reported to Parler, which were viewed by CNBC, users on the platform made violent threats directed at &amp;quot;Liberal leaders, liberal activists #blm leaders and supporters,&amp;quot; in addition to other groups.

It's impossible to deny that internet access is pretty much a necessity of modern life. ESPECIALLY during covid times, when any equivalent real-life ""platform"" is unsafe.

"Okay. How about you go and rent out an ad on any news paper saying you want to kill the president?

These people said they wanted to ""hang pence"". They stormed into the Capitol with bombs, guns, and bulletproof vests. They killed police who were guarding our elected officials. 

There are laws that are in place to contest election and Trump filled numerous lawsuits. No one stopped him from filling them. They were mostly rejected because our government requires proof that they didn't have. Then he incited violence to attack elected officials, which is illegal because we have laws, and this caused the entire backlash you are seeing. 

You do not have the freedom to incite violence. This is what is being blocked, not political opinion. If I did what Trump did and got a mob to attack Congress, I would be in jail not just blocked from social media. You don't believe me? Post your real name and address and say you want people to invade the Whitehouse and hang the current president. I'll wait. You will see the secret service at your door.

People saying they don't like what the president says IS freedom of speech. People saying they don't like what Trump supporters say is freedom of speech. No one stopped conservatives, including Trump, from saying Obama was a Muslim who was not born in the US for 8 years. 

You want to spread crazy conspiracy theories, go ahead. No one is stopping you. Don't expect us to help you either. You want a platform, create it because twitter does not have to allow you. You want to host your site, you can buy or rent servers on your own because Amazon does not have to serve you. You want to process payment, create your own payment processing or your own digital currency because Visa does not have to allow you. None of those companies are violating your rights based on race, religion, etc. They are protecting their business from hosting websites for terrorists or processing payment for terrorists because that's what those people are. Terrorists. They are threatening violence for political gain.

As a developer, I can personally create a website and an app for both ios and Android that i can side load which is possible with both platforms. I can create the front end and back end with any database to back it. I can buy a domain name and a certificate for that domain. I can then host my site and api on any computer using Linux. No one will stop me from doing that. You can even create your own isp if you want. However, Amazon, Visa, mastercard, etc are not required to provide me service because they are not utilities. They are companies that have their own service agreements that you must accept to use their service.

"Maybe you should explain.

To read your response within the context of previous messages, including your own, it seems that you are making a point that this particular incident, which involves companies not serving other companies due to some violation of their terms or possible legal liability, you were saying that the answer to AWS' response is to make your own government that will not allow this restriction but they will not allow you to do that.

If that was not your point, I sincerely apologise because recent events have caused a reaction to protect my country from people who threaten its democratically elected government. Our country is far from perfect, but attacking the core principles of democracy is never the solution. The solution to correcting is imperfections is provided within the constructs of the current laws.

I am not a fan of restricting our rights, but this matter is not about rights since a company, Parler, has chosen not to block people who have clearly broken the law from inciting more violence. While the company is not responsible for the illegal activity of its users, having the government interfere rather than the company regulating is users would be far worse. If the government believes it needs to hold companies responsible for its users, it would cause a far greater restriction of actual rights and allow the government to manufacture and guide public opinion.

The best response in this case is for a company, be it Parler or Amazon, to take action based on public outage from its stakeholders. This prevents the government from regulating the company and preserves freedom of speech as long as the speech is legal. I think Amazon handled this correctly by preventing regulation through self regulation and blocking the Parler from using its services.

As I said in my response to the other commenter, it is possible for Parler to serve its own content with its own servers and not string along a giant like AWS.

AWS, Google, Apple, Twitter, etc. do not legally have the right to ban Parler as they allowed the incitement of violence, and the platforms that published the incitement, from Antifa and BLM, and have thus set a precedent.

&gt;Where do you draw the line for ""distasteful"" and ""dangerous""? Is porn distasteful? Are conspiracy theories dangerous? Is wanting to punch nazis distasteful? Is unbreakable encryption dangerous? Is calling for unilateral Catalan independence dangerous?

That's not my line to draw, because I'm not the vendor.

&gt;If you're a libertarian or anarchocapitalist I disagree with you, but fair enough—you believe that private contracts are the ultimate arbiter of legitimacy, I don't. 

I'm not either of those things, though on this particular issue I see no problem with a vendor saying ""no"" just as vendors have said ""no"" all throughout history. They're not saying no for some petty thing like a disability, a religion, or a sexuality, so there's nothing legally to stop them, and I think that's largely fine.

I do think the user should be able to install the app if they can acquire a copy of it though (which is really only a problem in the Apple ecosystem).


&gt;Parler may very well be an illegitimate and dangerous business that should be shut down, but that should be done following a court order following established procedures. 

I really don't think that needs to be a court matter. It might actually be far more dangerous. Courts really shouldn't deal with disputes like this between vendors unless the vendor is being discriminatory.

When courts start dealing with things like this, the government is the one doing the enforcement and that's far more dangerous than an individual publisher/middle man disagreeing with you -- something that's happened throughout history, publishers have never been forced to publish a book.

&gt; Today it is Amazon using their power and privilege against someone you (and I) dislike... and tomorrow?

I mean as someone who worked for a company with a fairly large investment in AWS in the past, getting pulled offline would suck, but if they didn't want to host us, that's ultimately their right.

This isn't even all that strange, it's rather routine for hosts to take down servers that are doing illegal or dangerous things, just like good stores filter out crap products.

The dangerous precedent so many people are going on about is honestly meaninglessly laughable. Parler assuming they didn't tie themselves too much to Amazon specific infrastructure (which is just a bad idea in general) can simply find a new host that is willing to run their web servers or build their own web servers in a data center.

If you really can't find someone to host you in the plethora of available companies you're really doing something wrong. You're the guy who's renting an apartment and making a slip and slide out of the hardwood floors.

The app store problem is a bigger one, and that's where something needs to change if anything. Apple should not be able to determine what you're able to do with a computer. Google already has plans to improve the situation with the next version of Android on their side, but they've always let you install apps from 3rd party sources.

"This was literally division in action, and Redditors celebrated it. Then they complained about how divisive the US was/is over the next 3 years.

The division was caused by the actions that everyone here supported. Redditors celebrated as these companies separated us into our bubble because we didn't like to see people who disagreed with us. And once they were gone, both them and us became more rooted in our beliefs, good and bad. 

Without dissenting opinions, beliefs march towards the extremes, which is almost always a worse place to be. 

Companies talk about ""diversity"" fostering better environments, and that people provide different perspectives on issues and problems. By removing the entire right-wing perspective, news is presented with a complete bias. All news is biased in some way, whether intentionally or unintentionally, having people who inherently want to find a way to disprove the article are helpful for identifying flaws or half-truths in an article and coming closer to reality. Without dissenting opinions, people take news at complete face value, any article, no matter what, if it supports what we support, it must be 100% factually correct. People should know that's bullshit, but they want to believe, so they just do.

I think the actions that tech companies are showing over the past few days will have serious ramifications over the coming weeks, and I expect there to be further purges of right-wing subreddits, /r/conspiracy is number 1 on the chopping block, and perhaps even /r/Conservative. These actions embolden tech companies, which are largely left-wing companies run by left-wing people, to take further action. The internet is almost universally controlled by a small handful of private companies. These companies hold your speech in their hands. If they don't want what you say to exist, they can essentially make it so. If Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, IBM, Twitter, Facebook, and Oracle decide they don't like what you're saying, you've essentially been silenced. It's akin to saying ""Sure, you have free speech, if you're in your own house, by yourself.""

I firmly believe that these companies are the modern day press, and modern day street corner, and that freedom of speech should be required on these websites. It is far too easy for companies to essentially form an equivalent of the Great Firewall for anything they personally don't agree with. And no, I don't think that what Trump is/was saying isn't dangerous. I agreed with the temporary muting of his account, but I'm worried about where this will stop. I don't want to see a future where the internet is only left-wing opinions that are acceptable by whoever works in Silicon Valley. Difference of opinions are what allow people to challenge themselves, come to a combined understanding, and hopefully come away having learned something and possibly changed their mind. If everyone just circlejerks over their shared opinions, we aren't improving or advancing at all.

As a strong supporter of freedom of speech, I am afraid of what the future of the internet and freedom of speech will be. It's unfortunate that freedom of speech advocating platforms are largely right-wing, because much of their content I don't agree with, but I still believe they should be allowed to say it.",1610279785.0,1

It's very obvious that although preventing violent/illegal content may have been an effect from this, the true goal of this was political in nature. To understand why, it's important to keep the timeline of events in perspective. Parler was, for better or worse, advertised by word of mouth from political pundits as a ""free speech alternative"" platform to Twitter. When Twitter started tagging, labeling, and modifying Trump's tweets, this was suggested loudly by a handful of prominent right-wing talking heads and content creators. 

This next part is a pattern that has been repeated in seemingly three steps for major bans of individuals, but not platforms: Media framing and pressuring platforms to take action, politicians using political speech to admonish and demand direct censorship, and censorship occuring.  As this message caught ground, CNN (and many other minor publications) put out nationally televised video segments and articles likening Parler to a, paraphrasing, ""threat to Democracy."" Then politicians like Senator Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pressured Apple and Google publicly to take Parler off of their app store, then a letter was presented by Amazon employees demanding they not provide web hosting services to the platform. Apple told Parler two days ago that it had 24 hours to come up with a moderation plan that suited Apple's standards or it would be taken off Apple App Store. They did take them off, Google's Play store shortly followed. Then Amazon stripped them of their hosting services. This all happened within 48 hours of each other.

By advocating for the free speech of amazon to do what they want with the platform they own, where you seem to be advocating for the government to step in and tell them what speech is allowed?

Hmmm..... You sure seem confused.

And again with this 'any and all alternative opinions' nonsense. I think black licorice is disgusting, but if you want to advocate for how good it is I don't see any reason to censor you.

"This is the wisdom that needs to be propagated. (I'm older, too).

Remember the higher ideals; Freedom of speech, a nation of law (which *everyone* must obey), justice system with due process, etc. When these things work against your world view, it's tempting to squash them, but I would implore people to imagine any new departure from these tenets being used in the future by those with an opposite world view from yours. 

My examples:

1) All forms of rioting, looting and vandalizing are illegal, impinge upon the rights of others and must be prosecuted. This applies to Right Wing, and Left Wing. It applies to everyone all the time. In the past 10 months I have witnessed a lot of these activities, accompanied by arguments as to why it's justified *this time*. From where I sit, I literally hear no difference between this argument when it comes from the left or the right. ""But we are beyond frustrated and the only way to bring change is to create enough chaos to bring attention to our cause.""  The levels taken may have been different, and the law will deal with those differences accordingly. If you find yourself saying, ""But the rioting that I am talking about is an exception and is important for advancing social justice."" just remember that many other people feel that same way, except their cause is the polar opposite of yours. Who is to decide?

2) Religion does NOT belong in the schools, or anywhere in Government. The moment we say it does, who's to say *which* religion. Christian, Muslim? Hindu? You have to think about the grander picture of why freedom of religion, and separation of religion from government is so elegant and provides the freedom we aspire to. Imagine a future where you are Christian and your schools are teaching Muslim religion only, with the saying, ""Allah must be in the schools to bring back peace and justice."". If you find yourself saying, ""But my religion is the right one, and should be in the schools"", just remember there are quite a few people in our country who believe the same thing, only with a different religion. That is why we must always separate the two. 

3) Freedom of speech. Businesses such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and Twitter are not beholden to Freedom of Speech. However, they are working under the legal structure of a sort of legal ""pass through: where they cannot be held liable for anything on their sites because they are simply providing a ""pass through"" service to the public. (Others could say this far more accurately and elegantly but I believe you get the gist. All they do is allow people to type whatever they want on their platforms, they are not complicit and carry no liabilities for the content). Now that they *are* editing and controlling content, this could quickly change. If it does, the entire concept of the Web, and social media will be completely transformed where all content is monitored and controlled by the provider. We will have lost the ability to use our modern technology platforms for open dialog. 

The last thing I will say is to implore everyone to step back and think about what actions they believe should be taken next regarding the Trump and right wing activities of late. 

Are your ideas coming from an emotional reaction, or a thought out strategy as to what is truly best for all of us into the future. Referring to my first point above, every law that was broken by the rioters, and Trump himself must be upheld. But regarding stamping out right wing platforms, last night on my Facebook feed, I saw references to many new sites to ""jump to"" in lieu of Parler. They are springing up everywhere. Trying to stamp out right wing social media is not only fruitless, but fans the fire. 

The last thing I will say is that the media will put Trump up front all day every day because it boosts their clicks/ratings/circulation. Some in favor, many opposing, but make no mistake, their interest is in their own business model and not you or this country. It's not that they are evil, it's that any large business tends to take on a will of its own, much like any large government, or other institutions that grow large.",1610285040.0,1

"All violent speech isn't okay, both companies Twitter and Parler, should remove it. It's in both of their terms of service as it's not protected speech. Twitter is a multi million dollar company with thousands of employees, do they remove content better, absolutely but they're not perfect either. So to say Parler needs to do it better, how can they as they're such a small company? No company is responsible for what it's users do/say with their products.

For years people have said ""you don't like Amazon or Twitter, go make your own"", some company finally does and it starts to gain traction, Apple and Google remove the apps then Amazon shuts down business with them. What if the credit card companies start shutting down payment processing for services/products they don't agree with? Is that okay? No.

If someone drinks and drives, is the alcohol company or car manufacturer responsible for the car accident? No they're not, same with Twitter/Facebook/Parler/YouTube not being responsible for what users post. People say they're hosting the data, so then they're responsible. I disagree, they are simply the platform. If there's a religious nut job on the street corner screaming about how being gay is sin and the devil is coming, I don't go after the city for hosting him. It's all bananas. 

The real issue with all of this is that it is a very slippery slope. Because whats to stop them from going after anything they disagree with? You can say tinfoil hat conspiracies all you want, but it's a very real concern. What's to stop Google/Apple from monitoring your texts or video calls, they're hosting them, should they be removed? Should Signal loosing it's encryption so big brother can monitor those messages? The answer is no. These companies have a very real monopoly and it's only getting worse. There can never be a better service that comes out, if the competition is nuked because someone used it maliciously.

"I am not a tech savvy guy, and I know emotions are running high on all of this.  But I have some concerns on the precedent this sets.  Personally, I think the Apple, Google removal of the Apps is a bit of a reach, but defensible.  However, the AWS move is a lot different.  If Amazon can decide they don't like the content that your company is providing on their servers, which you are a paying customer for...then I would think that any company that uses their services would have to be concerned over this.  If a private company that uses AWS now has to be concerned that their hosting company is monitoring their content and that there is a potential threat of being shut down in 24 hours.  You would have to rethink your cloud hosting services.  For example, what if a company that provides shareholder data ranking; gives amazon a bad score...but that company uses their hosting services...theoretically, Amazon could ""shut them down"" - it doesn't theoretically ""kill"" the company, but it puts a massive unneeded burden to try and get back online.  It would essentially put them out of business, or at least severely cripple them.  I could see this being used as corporate extortion.  I know that this is a different situation; but the precedent it sets has to strike some fear into every company that uses them.  

I would think that Parler has a law suit that they could put forward.  If you remove the emotion from it all, which I would assume would be done in a court; Their site was at its peak of new growth and the full weight of all major tech providers simultaneously shut them down; the lost revenue and momentum cannot be restored.",1610292594.0,-1

"&gt;Here's my problem. Why doesn't Facebook face the same consequences. There were instances of literal genocide being planned and executed on Facebook yet they have no problems with getting payment or infrastructure services.

Two major problems with this. First, Facebook has continued to commit to increased moderation. No matter how you slice it, they have been improving and getting better.

Second, they own their data centers. They aren't paying AWS, so AWS can't kick them off.

The pornhub standard is probably the closer to FB, because both were removing the content and it's against their policies. That is just life in a sec negative world though, which is primarily the result of conservatives.

&gt;They are also such a negligible source of hate speech compared to other, larger and more established sites. Compare the instance of the n-word on Parler (1.140 instances) vs Reddit (104.000 instances), Facebook (161.000 instances) and Twitter (234.000 instances).

So, Parler had like 100 people on it. That's 10/user, whereas FB and Twitter have Billions of user active every single day.

But, they aren't being banned because they allowed hate speech, it's because that speech was being used to incite violence. If they were just a bunch of racists saying offensive things, then the status quo would have remained the same.

&gt;What is left is an ideological tilt that is seen as the real reason Parler is geting censored. And that is in fact an attack on freedom of speech when it is being done capriciously and maliciously. This is why Amazon, Google and Facebook should be broken up, because they wield too much power over global discourse. This is not just an American thing, these companies influence how issues are discussed on a global scale.

Parler is getting censored for being OK (according to the CEO) with the violence planned on his site. Other leaders at least have the decency to tell us they care, whether or not that is true.

This case really doesn't show why any of those companies should be broken up.

There are many hosting places not just AWS.

You can download apps to your phone without Google.

I am not sure why FB is even mentioned.",1610303687.0,-1

"I don't know if you want or care about a simple explanation but here it goes.

Amazon built a building, filled it with computers and networking equipment, connected it to utilities, and are now renting the computers out through AWS.

Comcast moves data from building to building.  They are renting space on their transmission lines.  Net neutrality means that space on the transmission line cannot get special priority if you pay more.  It is important because the big ISPs have near monopolies over parts of the US.

If Comcast stops your traffic, you are fully off the internet to some users in monopoly markets.  There is no way to get around it.

If AWS stops renting to you, you can rent from someone else.  Apple, Google and Microsoft have competing products.  Smaller companies like Rackspace let you buy your own physical hardware and put it in their buildings.  If none of those options work, you can buy a building, buy some computers, hook up to utilities, and be back online in a few weeks.

"I reported several Twitter posts over the summer that were promoting violence within the BLM/Antifa sphere and they were taken down.

"What are you talking about exactly?

&gt;""...most Democrats were in favor of regulating large tech companies to ensure a level playing field and to protect individuals rights.""

Monoplistic/anti-trust regulation (the only ""recent"" thing I think you might be referring to) is totally different subject from freedom of speech, which is also totally different from ""protection if individual rights"". 

I'm not sure what you are trying to say, other than to conflate two totally separate issues to ""make Democrats look bad""/try to imply Democrats are hypocrites (ironic, at best).

There are two very different issues at play here. One is ""are tech companies responsible for what is posted on their site"". That is something that the Trump (the Republicans) have pushed for recently and is antithetical to free speech. The amount of traffic makes it impossible to perfectly regulate what appears and to force company liability for something that ""wasn't taken down quick enough"" hurts free speech overall. 

On the other hand, there is ""removing opinions that aren't agreeable"". As long as the removal is not motivated by racial, religious, disability etc. motives, then it is perfectly legal (last I checked, Republicans are not a protected group). Beyond that, a company can allow/remove whoever they want. Would it be smart, not necessarily, and people are free to choose to give another company business instead (the conservative movement moving over to Parler for example) but it is not illegal. Google can refuse to host whomever it wants (Parler can create it's own servers), it could refuse to host a competitor (i.e. Facebook or Amazon) or any small company if they are willing to deal with the ""blowback"".

One thing that often masqueraded with free speech though, is hate speech and inciting violence. Regardless of any free speech arguments, hate speech and inciting/calling for violence are illegal and can be prosecuted.",1610303989.0,-1
"&gt; they have no problems with getting payment or infrastrucure services.

They have their own infrastructure. If Parler went that route, they wouldn't have trouble staying online. Hell have you seen the amount of torrent trackers still online even though millions has been spent to take them offline. There's plenty of datacenter ready to receive Parler, Amazon was just not the right one for them.

For payments, that's a whole other ball game. There's many advertisers that boycotted Facebook over the years, which is how they mostly make money. I never looked at how they handle payment, from what I gather they are their own merchant thus deal with credit card provider themselves. It's much rarer that they do act directly against a platform, Pornhub is one of the rare case I know about.

&gt; Ignoring thousands of such instances on Facebook.

The difference usually is on whether they actively try to reduce the amount of instance/can possibily reduce the amount of instance. Facebook has more than 15000 people employed to deal with this, that's 10x the actual number of employees Mindgeek has in its entierty... and porn is a subject that can be much more easily illegal than Facebook content.  Sure Facebook has 1600 millions unique visitors, but Mindgeek has 115 millions too, so to be similar they would need 1000 at least.

I have no doubt Visa and Mastercard will come back on their decision once the new moderation from Mindgeek proves its effectivness.

&gt; Compare the instance of the n-word on Parler (1.140 instances) vs Reddit (104.000 instances), Facebook (161.000 instances) and Twitter (234.000 instances).

You really compare websites with billions visitor to one that mostly host conservative from the US? Not only Parler has definitely less has much less than 1% of the amount of people than any of theses others platforms have (which thus make them worse), but theses figures also seems way less than I would have expected on any of theses platforms. Where did you get theses figures?

&gt; And that is in fact an attack on freedom of speech

And we are back to something that has nothing to do with the subject at hand here. You are free to say whatever you want, doesn't means people will promote your content to others. You can try as much as you want to have 5 minutes on Fox news to talk about almost anything believe me, you won't get them, while plenty of people will get 5 minutes to talk about plenty of things more absurd that your subject. They aren't censoring you, nor are they infringing on your freedom of speech, they just choose not to have your subject on their platform, as it's not the kind of message they want to promote, and they got the right to. 

You can most probably find instance where a big social network didn't applied their terms of service equaly, I have no doubt many platform have some part of hypocrisis, but it has nothing to do with freedom of speech.",1610304344.0,1

"Not really. Setting up a server doesn't require months of engineering. It requires connecting a computer to the internet and installing a web server application. A beginner could do it for the first time in an afternoon. After that experience about 15 minutes.

Securing it against attacks and tuning it to best handle high traffic that an already well known site must handle takes an expert. Not that it's like each company or individual that does it reinvents that wheel from scratch!

If Parler is anything near as big as present publicity suggested I'm sure Parler has some crazy setup with multiple levels of caching servers and a unique database schema distributed between multiple servers to handle the load which may very well have taken months to engineer. I doubt Amazon did this for then though, they will just replicate that setup elsewhere not redesign it all over again.

A better reason why they can't self host is the internet connection. First, a popular site with a lot of traffic is going to take an expensive internet connection to handle the load. More importantly though whatever company they try to buy that connection from is not going to want to be their enabler any more than a hosting company would.

That is their real barrier to running in the US. Everyone has to go through someone to get to the internet. If they host themselves they still have to go to someone for that connection.

"We need to be careful in this moment in history. 

I remember 9/11 very well. I remember everyone in the nation being ready for war and wanting blood for blood. What we got was the Patriot Act and a bullshit war. Phil Donahue (a huge media personality) had his career ended for condemning going to war with Iraq. 

Right now everyone is freaked out and ready to anything to stamp out hatred, but don't forget that there has been a massive transfer of wealth (from small businesses which have been closer and massive corporations which have remained in operation) during the COVID crisis, that before the crisis they had gobbled up so much power and influence (especially over speech) that people were calling for them to be broken up.

https://youtu.be/6NyFRIgulPo

Big tech companies, especially those with social media interests are capturing a little bit more of the public square every time they shut down a competitor. And they don't like competition. Amazon carefully polices and prevents union talk (to the point of firing people) just like Walmart.  

The above relates to the events described in the thread title. As for local relevance, the sentiment of ""Fuck the Supreme Court"" for upholding 1A, we need to be even careful. We're now at a point in history where people are all too willing to give away freedom for a little perceived safety and to punish the bad people for being wrong. 

Defending free speech means defending speech you don't like. If you don't defend the right of speech of your enemy, you're not for free speech. Crises always test our principles and exigencies erode them (never let a crisis go to waste).",1610309132.0,-1

"I think it also begs a lot of questions about how these giant tech companies are regulated. Apple and Amazon in particular, really need to see some anti-trust regulation come their way. Apple can essentially just ban an app from its app store and that makes it impossible to run on their iOS devices. And while there are non-Amazon hosts out there, Amazon encourages its customers to use their proprietary tools to build their infrastructure, tools they can apparently revoke in a matter of hours based on their whims.

I think it's also reasonable to start looking at large communication companies like Facebook and Twitter less as private companies that can arbitrarily set their rules of conduct and more like common carriers who have to carry all communication unless it falls into categories specifically prohibited or regulated by federal law.

Like take Twitter's banning of Trump. It was basically just up to the whims of their corporate leadership. It's going to be used by plenty of autocrats around the world who ban political speech to say, ""hey, even the President of the United States got banned from online services, so don't cry foul when we ban the political opposition here."" And yes, there are platforms other than Twitter, but when the vast majority of the internet is facilitated through a few dozen companies and those companies can basically enforce their whims on everyone, that gives them an enormous amount of power to act against the common interest.",1610310556.0,1

People are rightly tired of FB, Google, Apple, Amazon, and Twitter, for many many valid reasons. Laws to break up their monopoly power are justified. People concerned about the effects of free and open expression are also right to be cautious, and I can't blame them for voicing that caution.

"Let me preface this by saying I think Trump and most of his family should be in prison for what happened on Jan. 6th. This sets a TERRIBLE precedent.  Parler itself did not incite the riot.  As far as I know they have not broken any laws.  Telephone companies and ISPs are utilities and therefore by law cannot disconnect your service because they do not like what you say (this might have changed under Ajit Pai/Trump), I would argue that companies like Google and AWS should be considered utilities for how much of the internet infrastructure they control.  

The idea that your entire website can be nuked off of its hosting service because someone at that company does not like you is terrifying.  This WILL backfire on the left hard.  The only reason it hasn't is because communists and anarkiddies do not actually threaten the corporate power structure.  When they advocate for destruction of property, this is something that threatens small businesses much more than it threatens big corporations, and in fact can even provide big corporations with valuable real estate when small businesses shut down.

The de-platforming on Youtube is bad enough where small leftists channels will get their videos removed and their channel shut down for things that are not even clearly against the rules, because no one wanted to speak up against it when it happened to Alex Jones.

"You can side load apps on Android. I believe Amazon still makes devices, and they have their own store available on Android. Samsung and probably other manufacturers have their own stores. There are also a few open source phones, although they mostly suck. Im also pretty sure parlor is accessible from any browser. These 2 companies dont prevent the app from being used, they just hurt it.

I also never said I support the bans. I am actually a bit divided. I could go on about the pros and cons of the Epic vs Apple store monopoly stuff, but in this case I would rather briefly focus on the moderation of social media. Currently, we expect these companies to moderate their own platforms, and if they fail to do so, we charge them on multiple counts of child porn, trafficking, etc. They have an enormous incentive to ban hate speech, and illegal activities. Parler does not moderate their platform, which is actually why they are currently in trouble.

Currently, social media apps moderate their own platforms by banning content that they dont feel fits with their brand. This means that some legal content does get silenced on their platforms, and their users fall into a heavily biased hive mind. The algorithms used to moderate, as well as the algorithms used to create your feeds, are poorly made, thrive under division, and are dangerous to our society.

We could, however, classify these platforms like telephone lines. This way, platforms are not held liable for any user posted content on their servers. This would mean people could speak freely, but also means they would leave illegal content visible for all to see. It would be up to the users to remove it, which can be much more difficult, or impossible, to track down.

Additionally, we can set it up so they only remove content upon presentation of a warrant. Which means shifting the responsibility of moderation to the government. Which means slow bureaucracy leaving child porn up for months/years after discovery, and higher taxes to pay for this incredible demand. It also means the government is in control of the censorship, rather than private companies that could fail if they go too far.

On an emotional level? Hell no, especially having been very close to being a victim to a terrorist attack that killed hundreds a few years ago.

Especially since the platform would provide the opportunity to people holding opposite views to criticize said terrorist messages and perhaps allow for reverting the extremization of some of them.

"This is scary.  The fact that all the comments I see here about it are uniformly cheering it on is even more scary.

First, I'm anti-fascist, anti-Trump, anti-racist, and pro-BLM.  I voted for Obama three times and volunteered for him.

With that out of the way, how can anyone who's anti-fascist and pro-democracy cheer this on?  It's completely insane.

We now have a tiny handful of megacorporations run by megabillionaires who are opaquely deciding what speech we're allowed to consume.  Why are people not only accepting of this but actually cheering for it?

The real problem isn't the idea that a business can choose with whom it does business.  In general, I think that's a fine idea, provided those business aren't discriminating on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.  The real problem here is the fact that we have an oligarchy of megacorporations and megabillionaires.  If we had a truly free marketplace, where there were hundreds of cloud providers, and they didn't act in lockstep with each other, there'd be no problem.  Cloud A would decide they just don't like Parler, don't want to do business with them, and boot them.  They'd just head over to cloud B and everything's fine.  

The problem is that there are **two** companies who, acting together, can prevent you from having a mobile app.  There are **six** companies who, if they act in lockstep, can prevent you from using cloud infrastructure.  There are similarly small numbers of companies who can prevent you from effectively caching content, processing payments, and all of the other stuff necessary to communicate to a non-trivial audience on the Internet.

And, we now clearly see that these companies *do* act in lockstep.  These megabillionaires' interests are aligned, and they are not *our* interests, even if we happen to be on the same page about hating Trump, nazis, and political violence.  Why are you confident they won't use this power to silence speech you do like?  Say, speech about forming workers' unions, or using alternative services to theirs?

That's the problem with free speech: when it's infringed on, it'll *always* be abhorrent speech that infringed on first.  Because 99.9% of people hate nazis, so making nazis STFU is something that's very attractive to almost everyone.  But if you give someone the power to do that, they'll have that same power to make anyone else STFU for any reason they see fit, too.

Here are the arguments I always see about why this OK and why I think they don't work:

1. Free speech is about governments, private companies can do whatever they like.
  * No, the 1st amendment is strictly about governments.  Free speech is a broader concept.  If the government permits any and all speech, but six corporations acting in unison have the power to effectively silence you, and they act in concert to do so in opaque ways, then that's absolutely a free speech issue.  We've lost the ability to communicate freely: it just happens that a corporate oligarchy did it, not the government, but the consequences are the same.
1. Free speech doesn't mean speech without consequences.
  * That's correct, but it's also not the argument.  People on Parler or whatever service should be held accountable for breaking the law there.  Incitement to violence and conspiracy to commit terrorism are already very illegal.  We should **not** expect (or want) the megacorporations to unilaterally and opaquely enforce these laws, we should expect and want or government to enforce them.  This is because when our government enforces them, they have to prove their case in court, and they're accountable to our system of checks and balances; they can't make arbitrary and opaque decisions completely unaccountably like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos can.
1. It's incitement to violence.
  * Incitement to violence is illegal.  It's a job for our legal system, not Mark Zuckerberg.  Also, when you have a platform with user-generated content, in general, we don't consider you legally responsible for what the users write.  You can easily find countless incitements to violence on twitter, facebook, and reddit, from both the left and the right.  Why isn't the reddit app being removed from the App Store?  Why isn't reddit being booted from AWS?  Yes, reddit has moderation policies aimed at preventing this content, but they're clearly ineffective.  Parler also had moderation policies about it (also clearly ineffective).
  * That's how can you make arbitrary enforcement decisions while pretending to be upholding your policies: if you write a policy that's impossible to adhere to, and then selectively enforce it against only those you don't like.  This is what we saw in the Jim Crow south (and continuing to the present day): make a shitload of impossible-to-follow laws, and then only enforce them against black people.  That's **bad**.  Fight against this, even when it starts out being used against people **you** don't like.
1. But Masterpiece bakery (the gay wedding cake case).
  * Did you *like* the outcome of that case?  Did you think it correct and good?  If not, then why do you think it's correct and good here?  That aside, there's not a ton of parallels.  I'm extremely against the idea that *any* business can turn customers away on the basis of their sexual orientation, which was part of the question in that case.  But regardless of that, Masterpiece bakery isn't part of an effectively monopoly, as Amazon, Google, and Apple are.
1. It just means they'll have to communicate another way instead, they're not being prevented from communicating at all.
  * The past few days have proven this to be the lie it always clearly was.  Twitter bans Trump, and people said, ""well, he can just use Parler if we wants.""  Trump says something about using Parler, and then the next day, Parler is completely wiped off the Internet.",1610319599.0,1

&gt;But Masterpiece bakery (the gay wedding cake case).
&gt;Did you like the outcome of that case? Did you think it correct and good? If not, then why do you think it's correct and good here? That aside, there's not a ton of parallels. I'm extremely against the idea that any business can turn customers away on the basis of their sexual orientation, which was part of the question in that case. But regardless of that, Masterpiece bakery isn't part of an effectively monopoly, as Amazon, Google, and Apple are.

So, you'd be okay with Masterpiece discriminating against same sex couples because they're not a monopoly, but not okay with Amazon refusing to do business with a company because they are? And your argument extends to oligopolies. How many participants does a market need before I can refuse to do business with someone? Or is it always N+1 if all the participants in a market don't want to do business with someone. 

Let's go full on absurd here. You open a business called CHILD PORN 4 YOU! It sells Child Porn. Mastercard, Amazon, Apple, and Google have to do business with you and it's only the government who can stop you?

&gt;It just means they'll have to communicate another way instead, they're not being prevented from communicating at all.
&gt;The past few days have proven this to be the lie it always clearly was. Twitter bans Trump, and people said, ""well, he can just use Parler if we wants."" Trump says something about using Parler, and then the next day, Parler is completely wiped off the Internet.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; With that out of the way, how can anyone who's anti-fascist and pro-democracy cheer this on? It's completely insane.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm anti-fascist, pro-democracy, and very happy about this. Because of the \[tolerance paradox.\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox\_of\_tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance)) People aren't radicalized in a vacuum. We don't need to tolerate or platform speech which incites people to violence, radicalizes them against political opponents, racial, ethnic, or religious minorities. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; We now have a tiny handful of megacorporations run by megabillionaires who are opaquely deciding what speech we're allowed to consume. Why are people not only accepting of this but actually cheering for it?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't love tech consolidation, but the idea that they're telling us what we can read is absurd. As others have pointed out \_\_in this thread\_\_ there are plenty of other places people can go if they want to hate Democrats and jews. Telegram, [REDACTED], gab, 8chan, just to name a few.  

&amp;#x200B;

These tech companies have de-facto control over \_\_checks notes\_\_ like two means of communication. If these people want to meet up in person, buy books, sky write, use IRC, distribute an unsigned Android app, get hosted in like any other country, host their own servers, go on the dark web, send pamphlets, have zoom meetings, do Skype, Microsoft Teams, smoke signals, HAM radio, whatever, they can. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; The real problem isn't the idea that a business can choose with whom it does business. In general, I think that's a fine idea, provided those business aren't discriminating on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay…

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;The real problem here is the fact that we have an oligarchy of megacorporations and megabillionaires. If we had a truly free marketplace, where there were hundreds of cloud providers, and they didn't act in lockstep with each other, there'd be no problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

There a surprising amount of competition in the cloud services space considering it takes hundreds of millions of dollars to set up the software and hardware infrastructure for distributed cloud computing. The market is free, it's just high entry cost. 

&amp;#x200B;

Your problem seems to be that the few people in the market…agree that selling services to nazis is bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Cloud A would decide they just don't like Parler, don't want to do business with them, and boot them. They'd just head over to cloud B and everything's fine.

&amp;#x200B;

But if B, C, D, E, and F also don't want to sell you services, either because they don't like what you're doing, or because of political pressure then you seem to still have an issue with it. If six different cloud services companies don't want your business because you're a toxic threat to democracy \_maybe\_ your business model is the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; The problem is that there are two companies who, acting together, can prevent you from having a mobile app. 

&amp;#x200B;

You can side load on to Android. No one can actually prevent you from having an Android app. You just may not be in the Play or Amazon stores. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;There are six companies who, if they act in lockstep, can prevent you from using cloud infrastructure. There are similarly small numbers of companies who can prevent you from effectively caching content, processing payments, and all of the other stuff necessary to communicate to a non-trivial audience on the Internet.

&amp;#x200B;

So again. Your problem is that a bunch of companies happen to agree that Parler is bad. And your solution is more companies, until one of those companies agrees to do business with Parler. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's not a viable solution for a number of reasons, the high cost associated with creating these businesses being one. But again, it presupposes that 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Parler is somehow entitled to operate exactly in the manner it wishes; and 

2. That company Z, who finally want to do business with them will never change their mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; And, we now clearly see that these companies do act in lockstep. These megabillionaires' interests are aligned, and they are not our interests, even if we happen to be on the same page about hating Trump, nazis, and political violence. Why are you confident they won't use this power to silence speech you do like? Say, speech about forming workers' unions, or using alternative services to theirs?

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't \_just\_ that these companies feel a way. It's also concerted political pressure from the moment, from their boards, and employees, and from the general public. These decisions are not made in a vacuum. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; That's the problem with free speech: when it's infringed on, it'll always be abhorrent speech that infringed on first. Because 99.9% of people hate nazis, so making nazis STFU is something that's very attractive to almost everyone. But if you give someone the power to do that, they'll have that same power to make anyone else STFU for any reason they see fit, too.

&amp;#x200B;

And if Amazon deplatforms all labor unions, they'd catch hell for it. And another cloud service would host them. Because labor unions aren't using AWS to threaten to kill members of congress. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; 

\&gt; Here are the arguments I always see about why this OK and why I think they don't work:

\&gt; 

\&gt;     Free speech is about governments, private companies can do whatever they like.

\&gt;         No, the 1st amendment is strictly about governments. Free speech is a broader concept. If the government permits any and all speech, but six corporations acting in unison have the power to effectively silence you, and they act in concert to do so in opaque ways, then that's absolutely a free speech issue. We've lost the ability to communicate freely: it just happens that a corporate oligarchy did it, not the government, but the consequences are the same.

&amp;#x200B;

You lose the ability to freely communicate only through the platforms that those companies control. See above.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Free speech doesn't mean speech without consequences.

\&gt; That's correct, but it's also not the argument. People on Parler or whatever service should be held accountable for breaking the law there. Incitement to violence and conspiracy to commit terrorism are already very illegal. We should not expect (or want) the megacorporations to unilaterally and opaquely enforce these laws, we should expect and want or government to enforce them. This is because when our government enforces them, they have to prove their case in court, and they're accountable to our system of checks and balances; they can't make arbitrary and opaque decisions completely unaccountably like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos can.

&amp;#x200B;

You conflate consequences for ""legal consequences."" If someone in my non-profit theater wants to stand up and say all women are terrible actors and we should go back to shakespearean times where all roles were played by men, I can and should kick him the hell out of my theater.

Thanks for taking the time to have a reasonable conversation about it.

&gt; I'm anti-fascist, pro-democracy, and very happy about this. Because of the tolerance paradox.

I thought about including a pre-emptive response about tolerance paradox but thought I'd wait and see if anyone replied with it first since I think it's one of the better arguments against my position and it takes time to reply to.  My main thought about it is that it's not real: we don't have examples from history of repressive governments being installed as a consequence of having too much free speech.  I don't agree that free speech is either a sufficient or necessary condition for developing fascism.  We do, though, have endless examples of repressive governments suppressing speech as a method for acquiring and maintaining control.  Besides, the sorts of speech we're mainly concerned about are *already illegal*: incitement to violence, conspiring to commit terrorism, and so on.  We don't need to give the government (or our corporate oligarchs) any *additional* power to protect ourselves against this possible future.  And in fact, allowing our corporate oligarchs the power to moderate our political speech is a pretty good way to bring that future about.

&gt;  People aren't radicalized in a vacuum. We don't need to tolerate or platform speech which incites people to violence, radicalizes them against political opponents, racial, ethnic, or religious minorities.

Incitement to violence is already illegal.  While I'd love to have a way to prevent people from developing racial hatred, etc, there's no practical method for enforcing that via speech controls without doing more harm than good.  Certainly handing the tech billionaires the keys to our democracy isn't a good way to do it.

&gt; I don't love tech consolidation, but the idea that they're telling us what we can read is absurd. As others have pointed out in this thread there are plenty of other places people can go if they want to hate Democrats and jews. Telegram, td.win, gab, 8chan, just to name a few.

But it sounds like you'd be happy if all of those places you list were shutdown by the tech oligarchs today, too?

&gt; These tech companies have de-facto control over checks notes like two means of communication. If these people want to meet up in person, buy books, sky write, use IRC, distribute an unsigned Android app, get hosted in like any other country, host their own servers, go on the dark web, send pamphlets, have zoom meetings, do Skype, Microsoft Teams, smoke signals, HAM radio, whatever, they can.

As I said in my original comment, the events of the past couple of days expose this lie.  The mobile app example alone should be troubling to anyone who cares about civil rights.  It's not reasonable to expect people to switch from ios to android and sideload an app to be able to access certain otherwise-legal political speech.  In general, our courts reject these arguments (that a right is intact if there are other ways to exercise it even if the law in question removes one/some of those ways).
 
&gt; There a surprising amount of competition in the cloud services space considering it takes hundreds of millions of dollars to set up the software and hardware infrastructure for distributed cloud computing. The market is free, it's just high entry cost.

It's an effective monopoly controlled by a handful of companies that are now acting in unison on this issue.  There aren't nearly enough viable competitors for it to be an effective market.  And, crucially, nor will there ever be.  Partly because of that high entry cost you mention, but also because if a new company does start showing success, it'll just be bought by one of the existing dominant companies.

&gt; Your problem seems to be that the few people in the market…agree that selling services to nazis is bad.

The problem is that the market is dominated entirely by about half a dozen companies who are acting together to decide, in an unaccountable way, who is and isn't worthy of having a voice.

&gt; But if B, C, D, E, and F also don't want to sell you services, either because they don't like what you're doing, or because of political pressure then you seem to still have an issue with it. If six different cloud services companies don't want your business because you're a toxic threat to democracy maybe your business model is the problem.

All six companies in question also have a stake in not having their workers unionize and in preventing new competitors from emerging.  Are you OK with them suppressing speech that furthers *those* goals too, by the same argument?  I.e., that if all six companies agree something should be silenced, it should be silenced? 

&gt; You can side load on to Android. No one can actually prevent you from having an Android app. You just may not be in the Play or Amazon stores.

I addressed this above.

&gt; So again. Your problem is that a bunch of companies happen to agree that Parler is bad. And your solution is more companies, until one of those companies agrees to do business with Parler.

I addressed this above, too.

&gt; This isn't just that these companies feel a way. It's also concerted political pressure from the moment, from their boards, and employees, and from the general public. These decisions are not made in a vacuum.

The companies are in control.  I didn't elect their boards and employees, and I don't want my democracy in their control.

&gt; And if Amazon deplatforms all labor unions, they'd catch hell for it. And another cloud service would host them. Because labor unions aren't using AWS to threaten to kill members of congress.

How would you even know if Google, Twitter, or Youtube were demoting pro-union content?  Parler, as a company, didn't threaten to kill anyone.  Some people used their open platform to do that (while also using it for other legitimate purposes).  Users have used (and continue to use) reddit to do the same.  Threatening to kill someone is illegal.  It's a job for our legal system to determine if someone did that and punish them for it.

&gt; You lose the ability to freely communicate only through the platforms that those companies control. See above.

I address this above.

Amazon doesn't own a social network, so how is denying the use of AWS helping them squash an opponent? Parler was paying AWS so this move results in less revenue for Amazon.

Apple and Google don't compete with Parlor, so how is removing it from their app stores unfair competition?

Your entire premise makes no sense because these companies aren't competing with the people or apps you allege they are using monopoly power to gain unfair market power over. Instead, private companies are simply enforcing their Terms of Service on customers and exercising their right under the free market to deny service to a customer who breaks their TOS.

There are plenty of alternatives for Parler and people banned from Twitter/FB/Youtube. They can purchase their own servers like every company did before AWS. They can distribute their app through 3rd party app stores or make a web-based client. And once Parler does that, people can use it.

&gt;A monopoly on free speech (or a monopoly in general) is not a hallmark of the free market. Free markets are meant to induce competition between firms, Monopolies restrict that from happening.

This is not about speech. This is about calls to violence and coordination of violent actions. That is why these users and Parler were suspended by these companies.",1610333810.0,-1
"Google, Apple, Amazon and Twitter are in the business of making money. As it turns out, allowing an effectively unmoderated social network to advertise or host itself on their services is bad for business. People have a right to express their beliefs, but they aren't entitled to do it on someone else's platform. As the phrase goes, ""My house, my rules.""

The only major concern is whether the entire market is actually engaging in anti-competitive behavior by coordinating to deplatform Parler with the *intention of preventing competition*. That doesn't appear to be the case here. Parler is very clearly a loosely moderated platform that violates the terms of service of each of these providers.

These providers aren't getting together thinking to themselves: ""Well, shit. Parler might cut into our market share, we should shut them down."" It's more like: ""Parler is in violation of our terms of service, allowing them on our platform would be bad for business.""

Parler has been informed of the ToS violations. They can either make the necessary corrections or continue to cry about it. Given what I've seen of Parler, I would strongly disagree with any claim that this is an instance of anti-competitive behavior.",1610334138.0,-1
"Google, Amazon and Apple do not want to be held liable for what their users post.  Yet they hold other apps to a different standard. 

No.  They shouldn't be forced to provide services.  They choose to provide services and now are stopping because they want good press.

I don't support the hatred and violence being posted.  However, the platform shouldn't be held responsible unless all platforms are held responsible.  

The US Courts have already decided that platforms are not liable if they don't editorialize or approve of posts.  Section 230 allows platforms to restrict the worst posts without being forced to approve all.  

If a platform does not censor any posts, they are not liable via the law.

So instead, the land of free speech makes it popular to censor unpopular speech.

Hold the poster of hate speech liable.  Not the platform.",1610334581.0,-1
"They can self host.

I agree with App Store argument but not with cloud infrastructure. There are two viable mobile app stores and they do have way too much power, but cloud infrastructure has many players and self hosting is a viable substitute.

I mean, there's also a political reason for them getting booted from everywhere, but the moderation issue is technically the main reason.  

Honestly it would have just been better to leave them alone and not ban people from sites like Facebook and Twitter when they are dumb enough to plan crimes on a public forum to make it easier for the FBI to track them down.

Social media gets A LOT of engagement from its conservative viewers, whose content is usually the most accessed on these platforms. These platforms are going to try their best to play both fields, because realistically, they need to appease users and politicians from both sides of the aisle to keep their gig going. Parler could have worked with google/apple/amazon and they chose not to, and so they noped the fuck out. And it's not just ""oligarch"" corporations that did so, Parler's lawyers noped out too, which is super rare for a lawyer to do - it's just cause Parler had become associated with toxicity and they weren't demonstrating a good faith effort to do something about it.",1610337801.0,1

There is no sane company in the United States that would want to be within 100 miles of that relationship right now. The toxicity from that network will almost assuredly spill over to any company that holds a business relationship with Parler.

This was not a political decision, it was a business decision, just like the business decision that Parler made to attempt to invite Trump's insane base of users onto their platform.

"So let me explain net neutrality as it actually is. Net neutrality as proposed, only applied to ISPs. Amazon/google/apple/fb all completely uninhibited. Net neutrality was about marketing analytics. Google apple Microsoft and fb make hundreds of millions (google billions) off of selling ad revenue based on targeted after rising. When you go to google and bing, the second the site is up and run It is monitoring every keystroke and mouse placement in the browser. It knows where you hovered your
Mouse and for how long, what you typed and deleted, it’s all collected under “session activity” and you agreed to it in their ToS. ISPs collect everything you do traffic wise, but they don’t track things you don’t submit, if you type up a diatribe outlining your anger towards a politician, but you don’t hit submit, the ISP doesn’t have that info, FB or other social media does have that info. That helps their advertising for clients. The reason the big tech companies wanted net neutrality wasn’t to help consumers, it was to eliminate literally their only competition for internet marketing revenue. Amazon for instance before net neutrality, through their AWS, gives their clients faster network access to their clients, that means their clients get faster access to data than those that aren’t their clients that is “tolling” the internet that they said net neutrality was meant to stop, except that net neutrality doesn’t stop Amazon from doing that, only ISPs. Internet based corporations have almost no restrictions from net neutrality, only ISPs which creates less competition.  Net neutrality wasn’t a valid answer to the issue. A law saying no company can restrict internet access and bandwidth speed was what was needed, but google/Microsoft/apple/fb would never agree to that",1610339809.0,-1

"I tend to think of websites and companies that host websites, such as Amazon, as on par with broadcasters and cable stations before the Internet.  Before the Internet we had five companies controlling every bit of access to information, and they had a 100% say in what that information was and how it was presented (Fairness Doctrine repeal aside); there was also no chance a viewer could engage with their fellow audience, while now we have the ability to share our ideas with our fellow audience in real time.  

All of those broadcasters decided what would go on their channels because advertisers were willing to sponsor the content, period.  The only point of content (not PBS and a couple other exceptions) is make money, so without sponsors, no content.  

That's the situation AWS and all the other webhosting vendors are in now, it's not different.  If they broadcast content, whether they are legally responsible for what users choose to broadcast or not, their advertisers will hold them responsible because their consumers will hold the advertisers responsible.  I see this more as an issue of capitalism than free speech.

I personally don't know much about Parler, but what I've heard isn't good. So I can't say I feel too sorry for them having hosting issues. However, there are people out there who already feel very disenfranchised by FB/Twitter/other traditional social media outlets, and are joining places like Parler less because they are interested in inciting violence, and more because they want to be in a place where they feel they won't get treated poorly for their values. I know this because I'm close with someone who's doing something like this right now (though not with Parler). They have seen their posts on FB disappeared with no explanation, despite nothing illegal being mentioned in them, and have concluded FB seems to be actively removing their content to silence them because of their political and religious beliefs. In the absence of any information from FB on the matter, it's hard to say definitively that isn't the case.

This is pure hypocrisy by tech companies - their platforms are guilty of exactly the same things that they are saying parler is guilty of AND the entire reason platforms like Parler have come into existence in the first place is because of the censorship faced on those other platforms.

This is politically based censorship and while people cheer it on today, sooner or later they are going to be the victims of it and they won't be cheering then but it will be too late.

It shouldn't be up to other corporations to decide if your business or your personal hobby website is or isn't a problem.

It seriously shouldn't be that hard to foresee a situation where a group of legitimate activists or competitors get denied services by payment processors or server hosts and they're silenced as a result. In fact there's *already* been instances of that. There was a patreon altennative set up, and there's evidence patreon and payment procesing companies coordinated to drop support for it, which meant it could no longer operate and shut down.

&gt;You lose the ability to freely communicate only through the platforms that those companies control. See above.

Which is litterally the entire internet, since, again, even a website you yourself make is at the mercy of backend services to handle the highly technical elements. Unless you're rich and own a bunch of servers, telecommunications infanstructure, AND own a bank to control and manage transactions on the website, it's litterally imposible to not be under the control of some other private platform.

But it's undeniable that corporations are very good at comparing risk and benefit, and those calculations are made, especially in the case of Facebook and Twitter, based on public opinion.

In my opinion, Amazon and Apple's hands were tied, in that they couldn't be the last tech giant providing a service to a platform that helped staged a coup, while the other companies already took action. Public image matters to all corporations, not just social media. How many people canceled their Prime when they learned Amazon warehouses aren't the best place to work?

"I think you're conflating avoiding bad press and a bunch of loud cunts in twitter with actual consumer opinion. Rarely has any hot controversy impacted the bottom line for these companies whether they took the position of critics or ignored them. Businesses routinely capitulate to cry bullies on the internet and new media. Very frequently these cry bullies are loud and have lots of supporters on Twitter, yet represent a very small minority of the population in terms of viewpoint. So I think it's incredibly unwise to assume that a strong business case can be made for every example of capitulation on the part of a big brand or company.

In this case, Apple and Amazon were risking nothing by not removing this company from their platform. No meaningful number of customers was going to abandon their iPhone or ordering shit from Amazon because they didn't cut ties with Parler.",1610354230.0,-1

We would need evidence that the further radicalization of people through Parler's shutdown is more harmful than allowing the already radicalized people organize and recruit.

Ultimately the problem is we don't have evidence. 

But moreover I would also argue that it is not entirely unwarranted. We already know people use these platforms to organize violence. Apple, Google, and Amazon know this and ultimately felt that Parler was not doing enough to prevent it.

If you want to use an app that Apple has removed from their store you need to use an ecosystem that allows it (for example Android users being able to install APKs not found in the Play store). It sucks if you spent a bunch of money on a phone that now doesn’t have all the features you want but you’re not being forced to keep that phone either.

That extends to Parler. They are complicit in the crime; and therefore, if someone like Amazon hosts it, they would also be complicit, and app stores that allow a criminal to advertise through them would also be complicit.

(A)any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected; or
(B)any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material described in paragraph (1)

"It seems like you came here to talk about the left and what they are doing. Let me just go ahead and make this conversation a little easier for you to understand, since you only seem to comprehend talking points if they refer to “the left” in some way. Here’s some things the left did not do. The left did not perpetuate a lie that Trump won an election that he factually did not win. The left did not threaten violence against people who did not believe in that lie that the left did not perpetuate. The left did not storm the capitol based on the lie that Trump won the election that the left did not perpetuate. The left did not, after months of not freaking out about “blue lives matter”, beat a police officer to death while not storming the capitol believing a lie that the left did not push on Twitter. The left wants to prevent future riots and failed insurrections by holding the people who did all of the above things (that again, the left did NOT do) accountable. 

The left did not ban people pushing violence on Twitter from Twitter. Twitter did. The left did not make Amazon stop serving parlers website. Amazon chose to stop doing that. These are private companies, meaning they are not the left. I know I brought in a new term there, “private company”, but I defined it using a term you understand (“the left”) so hopefully my definition makes sense to you. 

Hopefully this clears things up a bit for you. You seem very concerned about what the left is doing and I just wanted to make sure you understand exactly what the left is doing, to better connect with you in the language you prefer to use.",1610392639.0,1

"&gt;this doomsday hypothetical of the tech industry shutting down access to the internet or deplatforming everyone with a specific political affiliation or other classification

This is the only point I disagree with you on; [Amazon owns over 40% of the internet's infrastructure](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/28/17622792/plugin-use-the-internet-without-the-amazon-cloud), which is strongly in ""they have a monopoly on this shit"" territory, as well as Google and Apple's 100% ownership of their respective device marketplaces. If you consider [why we have anti-trust laws in the first place](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law), it seems obvious to me that corporations can and will absolutely use their power to push political agendas and destroy potential competition before it can even start. FWIW don't you think it's a little questionable when a company says ""we won't work with them because they're racist,"" then completely removed your ability to see the content that would prove or disprove their claim?

"&gt; Twitter works very hard on state of the art methods of weeding out illegal content in order to be in compliance.  

Twitter moderates their platform to remove material they don't like from being published.  Parler allows users to do their own moderation, determining what kind of content they do and don't want to see, without interference by Parler.  Why is one better than the other?  

&gt; There's a pretty big difference between removing something because you don't like it and removing it because it doesn't comply with the terms both parties agreed to.  

I'd argue that contract was signed, in a sense, under duress.  

Parler *needs* their iOS users to be able to install the app.  They have no huge desire to involve Apple in any of it, but by Apple's own decision, the App Store is the ONLY way to get apps on an iOS device.  Therefore, Parler's only option is to sign that contract.  

Parler did not negotiate any terms with Apple, there was no discussion.  It's a 'take it or leave it, and BTW if you leave it half the worlds smartphones can't use your app at ALL'.  
This isn't the first time this issue has come up- some pornographic apps have had the same problem with Apple's censorship.  

&gt; So change a core tenet of their business model to satisfy Parler users? It's not the same thing.  

So lift restrictions that Apple places on users' personally owned hardware that FORCES Apple to be the ONLY provider of apps.  
To be clear- I'm not saying Apple should host Parler.  I'm saying that Apple should EITHER allow users to sideload apps, OR remain neutral and allow Parler downloads.  
Apple has a right to determine what apps they host downloads of.  Apple does not / *should* not have the right to determine what apps users are *allowed* to install on their own phones.  

&gt; Comcast should be able to cut of service to a politician they don't like as long as it doesn't violate the contract they both agreed to.   

This is a better base of the argument.  If the options are Comcast 100mbit, or DSL 0.5mbit, that's not really an option.  
There are places where private companies serve a public duty.  Telephone and other utilities are among them- Verizon can't kill your phone line because you're campaigning for the candidate they oppose.  Hell, they can't even kill your phone line if you're breaking the law (selling drugs over the phone).  Power company can't cut you off because you advocate for more regulation of the power industry.  Water company can't cut you off because you oppose building a dam.  Gas company can't cut you off because you fight climate change.  These industries are largely private companies, but they are required to serve anyone who hires them, even people they dislike or oppose.  

Apple has, intentionally, set themself up that way by preventing sideloading of apps.  But they shouldn't try to have it both ways.  They should either allow users to install their own apps, or if they are going to be the only source, start acting like a common carrier.  

TO BE CLEAR- I have no problem with Google removing Parler because Android users can sideload apps; Parler can just distribute their APK directly or use a 3rd party app store like Amazon or F-Droid.  My problem with Apple is ONLY because they give themselves ultimate say on what a user *can* install on their own phone.",1610395075.0,1

Parler used Amazon Web Services (AWS) as their hosting platform, AWS is the server their website was hosted on. Amazon decided to drop Parler, thus taking the website offline until Parler finds a new hosting platform.

People scraped and archived all publicly available information from Parler before it went down, such as account names, parleys, profile info, and the like, as AWS gave Parler a warning they were going to take them down before they did it.

"&gt;  I don’t remember an ISIS social media platform 

ISIS didn't have one verified twitter account or official websites, if that's what you're suggesting.

They had many accounts controlled by their members with which they spread their execution videos. Don't you remember? 

They were immediately culled, as they should be.

&gt;What if companies silenced the Black Lives Matter campaign because some protest turned in to riots? 

There are many differences here. First off, BLM was protesting to see an end to police violence against minorities, which is disproportionately high. That is an actual reason. Overthrowing democracy is not a good reason to engage in protest.

Second,  there's no reason to believe that any of the people engaging in arson or looting were ideologically committed to the BLM protests. There is no connection between the goals of BLM and setting a Wendy's on fire. They could very well have been random shit stirrers using the chaos to commit crimes and evidence of such incidents were noted during the protests. 

Third, attacking the capitol building and subverting a free and fair election was the stated goal of the riots in DC. There was no other purpose. There is no charitable light for these insurrectionists to be seen under. BLM has a civilized goal, whether you agree with them or not. The insurrectionists didn't. 

And fourth, I'm ok with BLM accounts and websites being banned if they support violence against civilians or law enforcement. Incitement to violence is not something private companies have to tolerate. The problem is not that all conservatives should be silenced and indeed, many are still allowed their platform. The problem is that conservatives should not be allowed to plot acts of terrorism and in the absence of moderation on that front, such platforms should be denied to them. 

&gt; I don’t want us to give away our right to freedom of speech after 1/6 

This is not a freedom of speech issue. What is the alternative? Would you have the government FORCE apple, amazon and google to host parlor on their services even though they don't want to?

"&gt;FWIW don't you think it's a little questionable when a company says ""we won't work with them because they're racist,"" then completely removed your ability to see the content that would prove or disprove their claim? 

In this case, these companies are saying ""we won't allow you to use our platform under violation of our clearly stated terms of service, which you agreed to, for encouraging, supporting, and spreading lies about a violent coup attempt on the US government - and oh by the way - it wouldn't hurt if you could tone down the racism as well."" Twitter provided sources, [context](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html), and reasoning for the actions they're taking.

In Parler's case, Amazon simply told them, ""moderate your content to prevent your app from being used to promote racism, white-supremacy, and violent insurrection"" or you won't be allowed to utilize our services. Pretty logical IMO.

It's not as cut and dry as them saying ""oh you're a racist, BAN"" like you're trying to make it out to be. Look at how vocal everyone is over Trump getting banned and Parler catching shit FOR ENCOURAGING AN ATTEMPTED HOSTILE TAKEOVER OF THE US CAPITOL. Imagine for a second the backlash that these tech companies would face if they were banning people left and right for no reason or simply because they were a registered Republicans or something. The world would burn.

People can claim that's happening, but there is an underwhelming (re: zero) amount of evidence pointing to that being the case. Anyone I've heard of getting suspended/banned/deplatformed has violated some terms they agreed not to violate and are only crying wolf about being some sort of victim while lacking any substance to prove their claims.

If you have an example of someone being deplatformed ""just cuz"" please send that my way, as I'm always looking to expand my knowledge of current events.

Your concerns are valid, and the subject of the tech giants monopolizing access to the internet itself is an important conversation to have, but this Trump situation isn't a case of that starting to happen, nor have I see any tangible examples of this hypothetical censorship being levied against someone for no reason. That doesn't mean it can't or won't happen, and like I said, I agree that it's a valid concern that should be discussed, but I'm not on board with crying wolf when people start getting deplatformed for encouraging an attempt to overthrow a democratically elected government.",1610397227.0,-1

Tldr: either support an open internet, internet as a utility, privacy rights, and net neutrality or suffer the consequences. If you don't like it maybe don't oppose every single fucking thing that would have helped you for the last decade.

Parler getting nuked had nothing to do with them being conservatives. They are also not only being nuked by tech companies all of their service providers as well including their own lawyers.

It's also hard to feel bad for this happening to people that have damn near zero understanding of the internet. If your business is so toxic that others don't want to be involved thats on you at the end of the day. They can self host if they truly want to.

I'm sorry that conservatives are against things like net neutrality and internet access as a utility. You don't get to deregulate everything and let big tech fuck people over and then soon as it effects you suddenly complain. Maybe, just maybe, a lot of people will have a good look at what they truly want the internet to be and say ""this ain't it"". Pretty damn hard to argue youre entitled to use internet platforms and make 1a arguments when you oppose things like net neutrality.

The real issue with all of this though is technological literacy. It's hard for me to say something is ""removed"" from the internet because I'm technologically literate, I can dig on the internet and navigate to what I want. Even if Google and Apple and whatever remove content it can still be made readily accessible if they (parler in this case) made it accessible, unless isp's choose to remove access but that's a different argument and solved with net neutrality . It's hard to see that being different than let's say Walmart refusing to sell a product. Like yeah I can't buy it at my local Walmart, doesn't mean I can't purchase it. Yeah google/apple don't want to list my website, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. 

Is it big techs people don't understand the internet beyond Google, Facebook, and Amazon? This is the exact reason conservatives oppose government intervention, they don't want the government intervening in the ""free market"". This is what the ""free market"" has created, massive tech companies are the gateway to the internet; hell not just the gateway, they are the internet for a large amount of people. Now you can make the argument of anti trust and anti competitive business practices but these aren't new things. Google, Apple, Amazon etc all have been a problem for a long time. They aren't now just magically a problem. Pretty bad taste to be against government intervention for a decade plus leading up to this and suddenly bitching about it when it negatively effects you.

I don't consider AWS to be cheaper because of their rates compared to renting/owning a physical machine (I assumed it's more expensive) but because of the time and overhead saved on operations work.

Where I work, we're spread across multiple cloud providers and luckily for us we're big enough to exert lots of pressure on the providers based on how much money we pay them. Every year, we assess whether it'd be more economical to build our own data centers and every year there's pretty wide agreement that it's cheaper (when taking all factors, overhead, additional employees we'd need to hire, etc.) to bet on the continued commoditization of cloud offerings over time. Time will tell whether we're right or not, but it seems unlikely to me AWS will be able to drive players like Microsoft out of the game.

Hell Amazon was buying up real estate left and right in downtown Seattle just so they own the entire building instead of having to share it with another company all so they could better secure the perimeter. I also wouldn't be surprised if Amazon scans and flashes (down to the firmware they get directly from the manufacturer and changing the reference file would require a high level clearance) every drive (HDD or SSD) that enters the facility and any that trip alarms get alerted to several people,1610401999.0,-1

Here is Amazon’s letter to Parler in full.

Dear Amy,

Thank you for speaking with us earlier today.

As we discussed on the phone yesterday and this morning, we remain troubled by the repeated violations of our terms of service. Over the past several weeks, we’ve reported 98 examples to Parler of posts that clearly encourage and incite violence. Here are a few examples below from the ones we’ve sent previously: [See images above.]

Recently, we’ve seen a steady increase in this violent content on your website, all of which violates our terms. It’s clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service. It also seems that Parler is still trying to determine its position on content moderation. You remove some violent content when contacted by us or others, but not always with urgency. Your CEO recently stated publicly that he doesn’t “feel responsible for any of this, and neither should the platform.” This morning, you shared that you have a plan to more proactively moderate violent content, but plan to do so manually with volunteers. It’s our view that this nascent plan to use volunteers to promptly identify and remove dangerous content will not work in light of the rapidly growing number of violent posts. This is further demonstrated by the fact that you still have not taken down much of the content that we’ve sent you. Given the unfortunate events that transpired this past week in Washington, D.C., there is serious risk that this type of content will further incite violence.

AWS provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we continue to respect Parler’s right to determine for itself what content it will allow on its site. However, we cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others. Because Parler cannot comply with our terms of service and poses a very real risk to public safety, we plan to suspend Parler’s account effective Sunday, January 10th, at 11:59PM PST. We will ensure that all of your data is preserved for you to migrate to your own servers, and will work with you as best as we can to help your migration.

"Here's the nuance


1. All of the democrat politicians who encouraged the George Floyd riots are still on twitter. It's absolute hypocrisy. There's people currently sharing CP on twitter and yet twitter hasn't been completely ruined like Parler.
2. Saying ""I Like Trump"" actually does get people banned and your head is too far up your ass to see that it has been happening since 2015. 
3. Fuck Antifa. Amazon is not a ""mom-and-pop"" organization and this is a straw man. Antifa groups are not actively censored so this is irrelevant. Regardless, I am in support of Antifa being allowed to broadcast just how fucking idiotic they are to the rest of the world.
4. This boils down to the debate as to whether or not social media has become a public utility. Would you be in support of cell phone companies being allowed to censor words in your text messages such as ""drugs"" to prevent illegal activity, or the big four cell phone companies being allowed to actively ban you for life from all of their services for having said something inappropriate/illegal over the phone or through text? 
5. Completely irrelevant strawman argument.


Imagine thinking anything on social media is real anyways. 80% of twitter posts and reshares are made by bots. Imagine thinking that the sudden increase in calls to violence couldn't possibly be related to a coordinated effort by the tech monopolies to proactively destroy one of their only forms of competition. Imagine being pro big tech monopoly in any sense of the word.

2.	It literally doesn’t. You’re a headass. Find me one credible source about someone being banned that wasn’t a bot or had other offending content. 
3.	Amazon has the same rights guaranteed to it as a mom and pop shop. Because it’s a megacorp doesn’t change the fact that it shouldn’t be legally required to house opinions it doesn’t stand for.

If Apple did not exercise editorial discretion, but only filtered out apps that were actively malicious (spammy, malicious, etc), I'd have no problem with them.

"One wrong doesn't make everything else wrong. Nowhere did I say Amazon is a perfect company, FARRRRRRR FROM IT, and they do get called on and should get called on their bad behaviour and practises. But kicking off hate, violence and other dangerous views from their platform, well no one period supporting that platform, isn't censorship and even if it was that's perfectly justified and needed censorship. Again, not everyone deserves to have a voice. 

I question censorship all the time thanks and am usually against it such as the way China uses it and the CCP. I didn't try to pin you down as anything merely pointed out that those are all dangerous and negatively impacting views to have and anyone that has those views should not be able to express them. You seem to think they should be so by association, you then support those views. 

Of course big companies sell your information and would crush you underfoot if it made them an extra penny? They're a bit business no shit lol. But again that has nothing to do with them simply not giving a platform to dangerous and negatively impacting views. 

You're trying really hard to make this into some big conspiracy lol. The ONLY THINGS that are being ""censored"" are voices that should not be heard. That's it. That means nothing and says nothing outside of these companies won't support violence, hate and misinformation. To an extent at least. Are you really telling me it would be better to allow a bunch of selfish brain washed lunatics to gather in one place together so they can plot more violence and spread their twisted messages further?? That is literally what you're saying. It's like you support domestic terrorism or something and are trying to hide it behind ""well if they did Y it DEFINITELY means they'll do X"". This is an isolated case. That's it.

"1. These were riots with prominent people making tweets encouraging them, but I'm gonna stop right here if you're going to turn this into a ""well my side is always peaceful and your side is violent now show me proof that I won't look at"" type debate. Furthermore, ISIS and other islamic militant groups have had twitter accounts that promoted calls to violence for very long periods of time. I don't use twitter so I can't give you specifics, but this has been an ongoing criticism of Twitter's hypocrisy for a long time. 
2. Not only do I know people personally that have had their accounts banned for pro-republican/conservative views, there have been countless facebook groups and twitter accounts banned by big social media tech companies for absolutely bogus reasons over the years. This is common knowledge at this point so if you've been willing to ignore it for this long I guarantee nothing will change your mind. Look into the two part interview Joe Rogan did with Tim Pool (a lefty) and Jack Dorsey (I know Joe Rogan is basically meme commentary but it's a pretty legitimate). As a challenge to you, if you can provide me the video of Alex Jones explicitly telling people to harass the families afflicted by the Sandy Hook tragedy, I will change my mind on this issue.
3. Is this a meme response? Not only is it a straw man argument and completely irrelevant, but Amazon is not at all treated similarly by the government to a mom and pop shop, and you would have to be completely out of touch with reality to think so. Either way, the debate is on whether or not the likes of Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have become public utilities like that of a cell phone company or water company. Because social media is now the largest and most popular source of public communication and often becoming mandatory by employers, there's a pretty strong argument that it is. 
4. The regulations are what is at question here; a water company cannot shut off you water because they don't like you and in most cases if you do something illegal. A power company cannot shut off your power in the winter, even if you don't pay. The cell phone companies cannot censor what you text and say on your cell phone, even if you're using it to commit a crime.


Another big question is whether or not the private business or utility is responsible for what their customers do with their product. For example, a gun store is responsible for ensuring that their customer is legally able to purchase a firearm, but they are not responsible for the customer's actions when said customer uses the firearm to rob a bank. A power company is not responsible for their customers' actions when said customers' decide to use the power to operate an indoor green house and grow poppy seeds to manufacture heroin. Cell phone companies are not held responsible when their customers use their services to organize gang violence, drive by's, drug deals, rapes, etc. Why is the underdog social media service being held to a higher standard than other, now less popular forms of communication?",1610415404.0,-1

Companies have been relatively pc lately but that’s not a promise they have to uphold. And maybe Amazon isn’t going to use it’s voice to silence BLM directly, but all of the guillotine people are threatening Bezos’s life. If someone posted about guillotining Bezos on Reddit you’d hopefully be bummed if he were to dox that person and have their lives ruined for “threats of violence”.

So, while yes people can go around and function outside of Amazon, and create their own social medias (*with blackjack, and hookers*), what will that do to our already fractured country. It's difficult to look beyond current events because Trump and his die hard loyalists are pretty much indefensible.

"Net neutrality is to prevent isp’s(people who run the cables to your home) from discriminating against certain web traffic. Amazon and godaddy are internet hosts not providers, they host the content with their servers but they aren’t the ones who provide it to you. Here’s the route your data goes. When you make a request it goes: You -&gt; ISP -&gt; web host. The web host then: You &lt;- ISP &lt;- web host. The reason net neutrality is seen as important is because the cost of infrastructure is expensive and the permits required by each city makes the barrier for entry by new companies extremely expensive. The cost for a web hosting service is not expensive in comparison. For a new isp it will cost millions if not billions of dollars to get the permits, lay the infrastructure, and have the tools and materials. For a web host they just need a building, a few servers that can be bought from companies such as dell or go for around $600 each for a decent server, and a business level internet service provider plan(deals are usually made so an exact cost is unknown but around a few hundred due to high bandwidth and needing fast speeds) so a few ten to hundred thousand depending on location. Ironically without net neutrality it means ISP’s are not counted as a utility so they can chose to not do business with anyone without a reason needed unlike with utilities such as water which requires a valid reason such as non payment. Net neutrality never required the hosts to host anyone they didn’t like because the free market has the ability to solve it but isp’s cost so much to create that the free market wasn’t really an option without also providing significant grant money to companies attempting to start. (The only new isp I can think of in any recent time is google fiber but it’s google they have the money and even then it’s in extremely limited locations.)",1610423662.0,1

In the event that we remove Your Content without prior notice, we will provide prompt notice to you unless prohibited by law. We terminate the accounts of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances.” AWS trust and safety team found 98 examples of violations. AWS also gave a 24 hour notice.

What we should have is something like the bill of rights for the internet, that protects certain actions and speech, while also limiting it and positing real world consequences and avenues of investigation into dangerous behavior like this. 

I also understand that this would be a very complicated endeavor, and will have it's own problems and downsides. But, it's gotta be better then what we have now where a few corporations can decide what is right and wrong. Yes, it feel great when it happens to actually bad people like these capitol hill terrorists.

We have rules around journalism and what networks and newspapers are allowed to say. A newspaper can be punished for ethical violations.

Social media has grown to have just as much clout and informative ability as newspapers and television does. And that's why we are in the mess we are in.

It does NOT mean having equal access to every single venue available for speech. Otherwise everyone who asks, should be allowed on primetime TV.

I dont know what the proper response should be to the events at the capitol. You seem to think they might have gone too far. Im not sure where I stand right now. 

Should Trump be banned from twitter?

Twitter bans peope all the time for violation of TOS for all different kids of reasons. We can all agree that say an ISIS member should be banned. So the question is what would Trump, a sitting president, have to tweet that you would agree he should be banned? He shouldn't be allowed to do anything without consequence. I think what my stance would be is that its not that fucking hard to not be banned from Twitter. We shouldn't even be having this conversation and I dont think any other president will have this problem. Twitter certainly doesn't want to be in this position. Trump has made Twitter more relevant than it should be in the first place.

Moderation of social networks is one of the most important issues we are facing in the world. Wars have been started in Africa because Facebook rolled out there without native speaking moderators. These sites have to draw a line somewhere. 

So should have Parler been banned? 

Im not sure on this. But they are well within their right, and like they say Parler is free to host themselves. They are not banned from the internet. Amazon simply does not want to host them, and they shouldn't be forced to. If you want to force a private company to do something you are getting into government regulation. A government regulation saying a site cant have an enforceable ToS would be ridiculous.

The full statement from Amazon makes enough sense to me.

Shrug. If only saying it would make it so. You have a premise but no evidence.

They are not perfect. They are overwhelmed with submissions and often only discover the shit when someone steps in it, but unlike Parler they make a good faith effort. And good for business? Porn would be great for Apple's app store, particularly now when their growth is all coming from services revenue. A boost to their app store income would be great for the shareholders.

So, why isn't there any porn on the app store? They could hide it away behind a X-rated wall easily enough.

Regardless of any of this, if you believe in freedom of speech, then you should also believe in freedom of association, which is a core part of freedom of speech as per the Supreme Court ruling in NAACP v. Alabama, 1958.

These companies are exercising their Constitutional Right to Freedom of Speech to disassociate themselves from Parler. Is that not allowed? If you believe in freedom of speech, then doesn't that also apply to companies? 

Rights have always been a double edged sword. That's no reason to take them away.",1610439574.0,1

"Google, Amazon, etc. have much more to lose from doing that than they would gain. Most of the privacy things people don't like about big tech companies aren't things they flat-out lied about, but rather things that were buried in the terms of service or even just agreed to directly by the consumer. 

I also think there is no way we wouldn't have known if there was anything like this going on, for two reasons. One, it would have leaked. There is no way these huge companies would be able to have huge teams working on something like this and not have leaks if something this bad was going on. We hear much tamer leaks from these same companies constantly. Two, even without looking at the source code, security researchers would have found the devices sending all that data to the cloud with simple things like packet sniffing on their network or even spoofing/MITM attacks to see what is actually going on.

I don't trust these companies implicitly, but I think a dose of realism is important when talking about these sorts of topics.",1610442178.0,-1
"True but our government commits atrocities all for favors or to further corporatacracy. They don't care about a foreign journalist who worked for our paper unless he could offer them something as far as intelligence or leverage. I invite you to John Perkins Ted Talk he talks about his old job and the atrocities the US does. The war machine is on the left and the right it's the people going from Government to corportions and vice versa who are the issue. Was even listening to Joe Rogan/ Tulsi Gabbard interview and she said the same thing John Perkins has said in other videos about it being on either side of the Political isle. BTW you know the infos good when he had his daughter's life threatened back in the 1980s so he wouldn't publish the book he did in the 2000's. Wanna know y'all's opinion if y'all watch atleast the first video. 

Encourage y'all to spread the message. I believe he only came out becuase he didn't like the injustice going on .

"No.  Parler getting dumped is a good thing and is absolutely not a free speech issue because:

1) Parler users *broke the law* by posting credible threats of violence (many of which were aimed directly at political figures) and openly organizing terrorist attacks. 

2) The tech companies in question demanded moderation of the users' posts on the app to remove criminal threats.  The administrators *refused* to do so, which opens the web host to criminal liability.

3) Amazon, Google, and Apple are not US government agencies.  They are not required to allow a site/app they host to expose them to legal liability for the criminal actions the app's administrators allow to continue.

The suspension of Parler is NOT a free speech issue.  It is a *criminal liability* issue.

If you want a social media network that is governed only by the principles of free speech, it must be owned and operated by the federal government.  End of discussion.",1610445965.0,-1
"Not hateful speech, criminal speech.  You cannot freely threaten to murder a member of Congress.  That speech is a crime.  Parler admins refused to remove it.  That's why Amazon dumped it.",1610446251.0,-1
"And...what? The FBI should have stepped in to keep it up so they could use it as a honeypot? That opens up an even crazier legal/constitutional can of worms that’s scarcely worth getting into.

Plus, Parler might have been publicly facing, but it’s still a *private* company who was doing business with other private companies (Amazon, Apple, Google, et al). The companies Parler was doing business with were all within their rights to terminate their business when it was obvious the site’s activities were violating the agreements they made. If I rent you a room in my house and find out you’re using it to meet and plan a bank robbery with your friends, I’m well within my rights to kick you out considering you signed a lease saying you would not use that room for committing criminal activities (planning crimes is crime, just so we’re clear).

What happened with Parler is no different.",1610446497.0,-1
"Yes but their standards need to be implemented fairly and consistently or else it’s not a standard. AWS has no issue hosting “unverified amateur porn” for instance on its servers. A genre of porn that is demonstrably full of underage sex, abuse and rape. 

So we’re clear here Amazon, Apple and Google are more comfortable with someone accessing the rape of a minor on their servers then they are a conservative founded social media app. 

Not to mention that this opens AWS up to being deemed an active publisher and not a passive platform.",1610449657.0,-1

No, you simply don't understand their issue. Parler wasn't banned for merely having bad content, but also for not having a proper moderation team to try to get rid of it.

"Section 230 would be more applicable to Twitter banning Trump, not AWS dropping information from its servers. AWS is more akin to Verizon or American Electric Power. And Verizon isn’t responsible for terrorists using their network to detonate a remote bomb.


Additionally, Parler does have moderation; they’re just not moderating the content that Amazon, Apple and Google dislikes. Which again means those three are operating as publishers not platforms and they are now opening themselves to some serious legal risks.",1610450663.0,-1
"Parler is banned from hosting on American servers. Pull yourselves up by your bootstraps and build your own servers.

"It’s a problem because these companies are monopolies. You can’t run a website without Amazon’s approval. You can’t fundraisers money without gofundme. 

But make your own fundraising service if you don’t like it you say... tried that, Amazon shut them down because they own literally 75% of the worlds web hosting. 

Make your own web hosting service you say. Well to do that you need your own architecture and underlying structure. Too bad no one will give that to you without Amazon’s blessing. 

We’ve given control entirely to amazon and there is no longer a way to compete or go against them.",1610451955.0,-1
"Okay, I’m a bit more clear now, thanks. And if I understand you correctly, you’re suggesting this is more a question of these companies *selectively* choosing to enforce their TOS and you think they could have chosen to keep Parler up without facing legal liability or as much public blowback (or maybe countered the blowback with the honeypot argument). Is that a bit closer? 

If so, fair points all, and my guess is that while you’re absolutely right that companies make all kinds of, shall we say, *morally expedient* decisions all the time and totally do get away with it both legally and in the public eye, the gravity of the current situation is much much greater than some people (especially the execs of Parler) want to admit. Parler played a significant and possibly culpable role in a *historic national catastrophe* that will be remembered as being as significant as 9/11. I would argue that we don’t even yet know just how big this is going to turn out to be, but I’d say that the execs at Apple, Google &amp; Amazon have enough of a sense to know that it’s time to nope out on this one before it gets even worse. And while I’m obviously no legal expert, I’m pretty sure they were staring down the barrel of some major potential legal liabilities which also played into their decisions. 

It’s *possible* Section 230 could have protected them, but they just weren’t ready or willing to die on that hill with Parler and tbh, I don’t blame them. 

There may come a day when some service that’s hosting content for, say, BLM organizers or some future company that’s building a version of Facebook for lefties (“Leftbook” or some shit, who knows?!) and then *they* suddenly get deplatformed for some reason. 

If and when that happens, we will have to debate it or have an honest look now at how to deal with all this and create sound policy &amp; regulations (you know, that shit Republicans hate with such a passion). But for now, I’m not too worried about that “slippery slope” idea because I don’t see it happening in the same way. 

Fuck it’s late and I need to get some sleep. Thanks for chatting and hashing out your thoughts. Sorry if I’m still missing any points. I’m way past my bedtime! Cheers!",1610452624.0,1
I wasn't saying they are the same thing it was an example of something that seems good on its surface but really isn't. If Amazon is decided what is and isnt morally right or wrong they could choose to remove every website that post bad shit they do. They obviously have every right to do so its a private company but where is the line do people only care when it effects them generally yes.,1610452848.0,-1
"You make it sound like the law has been finalized, where in reality this is all new and ever evolving. The tech giants and industry as a whole is in its infancy stage, and so is any legislation put into place to limit them, mostly held back by the technologically illiterate voters and politicians that create our current laws. 

Fear not, this will change. This isn't an argument that GoFundMe, Amazon, Google, Apple etc. can't do what they want *right now*, it's that eventually they shouldn't be allowed to, and hopefully won't. Companies are one of the worst entities to hold power at present, to which the level is unprecedented. Their ethics are flimsy and their accountability record makes police brutality look like a non-issue. It would be utterly fantastic if people realized they need to be reigned in and could stop riding corporate dick because they scored some easy PR points by *owning* your political opposition.  Thank God the EU is starting to show some teeth, even for unrelated issues, it gets eyes on the current landscape.",1610452910.0,1

"No it’s not. Then build your own monopoly. Again, the logic isn’t consistent. Twitter and Amazon provide services that coincides with mediums that objectively impact your quality of life as a business, consumer, politics , etc. People pretending the unique power distribution isn’t the case is just a lie.

I completely agree and understand the issue of social media and tech companies becoming so big, acting as a town square, and we still have some things to work out.

But this playing the victim card acting like Parler was a bastion of moderate discussion and debate between conservatives is such bullshit. It was a primary source to coordinate and facilitate not just terrorist activity, but an open insurrection on the government.",1610456038.0,-1
"I think the idea is that most of this site felt the need of net neutrality because they did not want private corporations (in this case ISPs ) to have the power to unilaterally deplatform people , sites etc.

How can you expect a start up to have a moderation team that can compete with the likes of Facebook and Google? Parler doesn't have the money to pay hundreds of moderators or developers to build expensive algorithms. They had moderation and there was a report abuse button but the standards set by Apple and Facebook and Amazon are unrealistic of a sub fortune 500 company,1610458537.0,0

"Net Neutrality is about data flow from ISPs, not businesses like Twitter and Amazon. But the concept of putting private corporations in control by revoking Net Neutrality by the Republicans is proving to hypocritical right now because they decided to let the ""free market decide."" So that's what is happening, these are private businesses and if Parler broke Amazon's ToS/Contract then they have every right to be removed. If these Right Wing People on Twitter are getting banned because they broke ToS then Twitter has every right to do so. It's just like if Comcast wanted to slow down or even block Parler unless you paid more, Republicans decided that was okay because they're private businesses and they didn't want big government. Why are they now all for big government regulations when it's against them?",1610458880.0,-1
"It was competition for twitter. 

A company Amazon signed a multi-year hosting deal with recently. 

Then Amazon breaks it's contract with Parler and severely damages the business of the main rival of one of its largest clients.

"I mean, net neutrality is an issue that covers this very topic. If we have net neutrality, then all ISPs have to allow all websites. Conservative websites would not be able to be censored at the ISP level.

They could still be censored by search engines and social media linking or mentions. They could also be censored at the hosting level like Amazon.",1610461462.0,1
"They could nuke the whole datacenter, and all thay would do is set off an alarm at Google/Amazon that a bunch of replicas went off-line, and traffic is being routed to the others. They would be under capacity for a while (and of course emergency services and law enforcement would be scrambling because of the physical disaster) but as far as impact to the network, unless the guards coordinated attacks across multiple facilities simultaneously, the network would not lose data or uptime, just temporary capacity. Important stuff isn't just set up with redundancy across multiple dats centre's, it's set up to be redundant across multiple continents.

"Yeah but when you have companies the size of amazon that are huge monopolies, that changes the situation slightly. 

That's such a cunty thing to say. It's people like you who interfere with anything that goes against the MSM narrative, and when we turn round and say ""can you please stop censoring and destroying our stuff?"" You're like ""haha, should have made it more robust!""

Why dont you just bend over, lube yourself up and ask the corporate billionaire class to please be gentle",1610464655.0,1
"Yeah, but none of this is true. 

You can absolutely have a website without Amazon. You can absolutely have fundraisers without GoFundMe. It's maybe not as simple, and you'll have to work harder at it, but it is absolutely possible. 

Seems more likely to assert that these cop-killing, Capitol-storming maniacs just don't have the technical expertise to build their own tech empire.",1610464751.0,1
"I think Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple (hell add Reddit in there) should all be investigated and regulated as to how they operate also, I am just pointing out that they are currently not required in any way to provide a platform to Nazi's and conspiracy crackpots to spout off their nonesense. I do not in any way view this particular issue as related to free speech at all, it is about repeatedly failing to take action to self regulate their platform or take action against illegal activity.

If one good thing (Parler getting knocked off the internet) comes out of the iron grip these companies have then I reserve the right to be happy about that one thing while still disliking the practices of these companies in general.

Facebook in particular spent the last four years propping up Trump and his rhetoric and only when they realized they would be facing at least 2 years of Dem control of government did the winds of change sweep in and cause a change of heart.",1610465758.0,-1

Amazon isn't ""censoring"" anyone. Governments censor. Private companies do not. Kindly use a dictionary to learn the meaning of that word. 

It's not cunty at all to recommend people inoculate themselves against messy interference by simply breaking away from those bad actors. If Amazon is so shitty, STOP USING AMAZON! Get one of those shady Republican billionaires to build a server farm, recruit coders, and set up your own damn system. If you really care about this little social network, act like it.

Sure, but it's 99% virtue signaling. These corperations don't give a fuck about any of this unless it's making them money. Once this shit becomes kosher, do you really think companies like Amazon or Walmart are going to let the working class protest or create unions once they figure out they have the power to silence anyone?

This wasn't on accident, and you sound like those who are ok killing 1 innocent person if it catches 10 criminals.

Yea they aren't ok with the right, but fine with taking and laundering terrorist organizations money....remember how that went? And everyone forgot about it.

&gt;They don't want to be associated with marijuana, that's censorship?

It is when you are using your monopolistic power to block peoples legal businesses. 

&gt;Quoting the ""First they came..."" speech like it's about censorship isn't even right, that quote was about personal responsibility of the intellectual class.

No shit, it means we have a duty in this country to uphold speech even if we disagree with it.

None of us are defending republican policy either. In fact most of us here disagreed with it in the first place. And sure the republicans are being hypocrites but is that something new ?.

Let's say Amazon decide that Twitter is at fault for the riots that broke out during BLM protests and shut them out. You don't think there would be an outcry from the left ? You don't think Amazon having the power to do that is ridiculous ?.

* Subpoenas. Subpoenas are valid and binding legal demands for information or
testimony issued by courts, lawyers, law enforcement agencies, or grand juries, usually
without any substantive review by a judge or magistrate. We produce non-content
information only in response to valid and binding subpoenas. We do not produce
content information in response to subpoenas. Amazon objects to overbroad or
otherwise inappropriate subpoenas as a matter of course.

* Search warrants. Search warrants may be issued by local, state, or federal courts
upon a showing of probable cause and must specifically identify the place to be
searched and the items to be seized. We may produce non-content and content
information in response to valid and binding search warrants. Amazon objects to
overbroad or otherwise inappropriate search warrants as a matter of course.

* Other court orders. Other court orders refers to valid and binding orders issued by
local, state, or federal courts, other than search warrants or court-issued subpoenas.
For example, we may receive a court order, obtained by a government entity, seeking to
remove user content or accounts. Our responses to other court orders depend on the
nature of the request. Amazon objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate orders
as a matter of course.

* National security requests. National security requests include National Security
Letters (“NSLs”) and court orders issued under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
(“FISA”). Our responses to these requests depend on the nature of the request.
Amazon objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate national security requests as a
matter of course. Amazon is prohibited by law from reporting the exact number of NSLs
and FISA orders it receives. Therefore, we report the numbers of such requests only
within certain ranges set by the government.

In this case they cut ties with a platform that was allowing violent extremists to plot actual attacks on our various government bodies.

Parler should have realized that was an issue and it would cost their business in the free market.

You are still free to complain and talk about it though.  Because you have free speech as a right from the government.  Your free speech is not protected from consequences or from free speech being returned to you (as Amazon and others did to Parler in this case) from others who also enjoy freedom.

Parler did not make it's own platform.  They wanted to build off of Amazon's backbone to create a platform where users were free to plot terrorist attacks.  Amazon, in all it's glorious freedom, has said no.",1610469062.0,1

The message to people who object to Twitter/Facebook silencing them is always ""you don't like it? Start your own platform!"". So they did, and created parler, and the response has been to lobby Amazon to shut them down.

Big tech made a big oopsie and is about to get regulated to hell. The last thing Biden or another future president is going to want is for some private company to be legally able to silence him when acting in an official capacity at a critical time - or to drop service for his campaign site because people don't like their message.

I keep seeing the ""gay cake"" argument, but Amazon/Twitter wasn't making a custom site or service for these people that they're silencing now. The cake store who didn't want to make a gay cake was willing to sell a completely generic cake to the gay folks. AWS is a generic cake, a twitter account is a generic cake.

&gt;You are suggesting that Reddit doesn’t enforce their own TOS because sometimes it takes time to ban a sub? 

I'm suggesting they shouldn't be immunized by the Communications Decency Act. Listen this Act says that websites ***are not liable for the content on their site because censoring it would be nearly impossible***. What this does is it separates websites into two different types. One that is private and monitored for content and one that is public and not allowed to be moderated for content ***that doesn't already go against the law*** because then it would fall in the former category. Those public sites are allowed to moderate submissions that are against the law, but they wont be held liable for it either. They cant just decide one viewpoint isn't allowed if they cannot prove that the entire viewpoint itself is law breaking.  

So what does this mean? Well when lets say CP is found on Reddit the government goes after who posted it and not Reddit. Why? Because the government sees this as just posts that have slipped through the cracks. My entire point is Reddit is hypocritical for abusing this Act and then punishing people on their site for things they are immune to. 

Think for a second. Because of this Act the government wasnt able to take on Parlor. Think about how much bullshit was spread by that site because it wasnt liable for the content posted there even though it was encouraged. Y'all had to get Amazon to do something.

Amazon has robust competition, both in the US and abroad. The problem from Parler is that they made themselves so legally risky and so politically radioactive that access to services is difficult. Given what I have seen out of Parler, they brought it upon themselves.

Hell, I don't want to pay to run more than a few Compute instances if I don't have to. Again, you seem to work in the datacenter business, so I'll take your word on most companies not using multi-region content delivery.

The AT&amp;T issue, which you brought up, knocked out an entire region's access to the *entire* internet. Saying that an AWS or Google datacenter can cause something even CLOSE to that magnitude is false equivalency. Some businesses being unable to access their cloud applications is not the same as millions of people being unable to get on any telecommunications infrastructure. Without devolving this discussion anymore, my central point is that, if a single Google, AWS, or Azure datacenter were to experience a violent and unexpected interruption of service, it would not cause any form of large-scale disruption that potential attackers would be hoping for. Would region-specific applications being run out of solely that datacenter be SoL for a bit? Yes. Does that mean that there would be a complete blackout of public services for that specific provider? No. 

These attackers aren't trying to take out local business' S3 buckets, they're trying to attack the nebulous concept of ""AMAZON"". Keep in mind, that's the only goal here. I'd wager that most don't even understand the concept of businesses being hosted in the cloud - they just want to hurt the company themselves. Google, Amazon, Twitter, whichever. It goes without saying that to take down Amazon (or Google, for that matter) is very difficult for a single attacker or group of attackers - what they see as a single website is a carefully-orchestrated global network of systems in dozens of countries, meaning taking it down is nigh on impossible (for a physical attack vector exploit, anyway). Causing damage to a single datacenter will simply not result in the type of service blackouts some random guy with a rented truck is looking for.

That makes it so that one of two things happen: either only Amazon removes what they consider bad elements and their competition gets the business, or if all of their competition takes the same action they must prove in court that it is not collusion and those actions are reasonably independently motivated by all companies involved.

"I get that a bunch of right-wing goobers are surfacing the issue at this time, but drop the partisan worldview for a moment.

Getting this right is essential to keeping a handful of corporate oligarchs from controlling what people can and can't say online, which is the only practical way to communicate political ideas today.

This issue first came up in CA in the 70s - much like the participatory internet is being gobbled up by a handful of tech platforms now, in the 70s CA's common public areas were being uprooted and replaced by privately owned malls.

Malls pretty much banned any political activity because it's private property, no first amendment. The problem of course is that if all public activity happens on private property, the first amendment is now meaningless - no practical way to sign petitions, communicate with people, etc.

So the most left-wing CA supreme court ever ruled that the CA's free speech clause applied on privately-owned public forums like a shopping mall, and the decision was upheld by SCOTUS as not being preempted by the first amendment [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruneyard\_Shopping\_Center\_v.\_Robins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruneyard_Shopping_Center_v._Robins).

The FL statute is a statutory take on the pruneyard principle.  Normally right wing nutjobs would oppose this for the same reasons they have net neutrality. This is a once-in-a-lifetime moment to get bipartisan consensus to check corporate control of political speech.  Wasting it would be criminal.

The problem is that there are two companies who, acting together, can prevent you from having a mobile app. There are six companies who, if they act in lockstep, can prevent you from using cloud infrastructure. There are similarly small numbers of companies who can prevent you from effectively caching content, processing payments, and all of the other stuff necessary to communicate to a non-trivial audience on the Internet.

And, we now clearly see that these companies do act in lockstep. These megabillionaires' interests are aligned, and they are not our interests, even if we happen to be on the same page about hating Trump, nazis, and political violence. Why are you confident they won't use this power to silence speech you do like? Say, speech about forming workers' unions, or using alternative services to theirs?

That's the problem with free speech: when it's infringed on, it'll always be abhorrent speech that infringed on first. Because 99.9% of people hate nazis, so making nazis STFU is something that's very attractive to almost everyone. But if you give someone the power to do that, they'll have that same power to make anyone else STFU for any reason they see fit, too.

Here are the arguments I always see about why this OK and why I think they don't work:

 1. Free speech is about governments, private companies can do whatever they like. 

 • No, the 1st amendment is strictly about governments. Free speech is a broader concept. If the government permits any and all speech, but six corporations acting in unison have the power to effectively silence you, and they act in concert to do so in opaque ways, then that's absolutely a free speech issue. We've lost the ability to communicate freely: it just happens that a corporate oligarchy did it, not the government, but the consequences are the same.

 2. Free speech doesn't mean speech without consequences. 

 • That's correct, but it's also not the argument. People on Parler or whatever service should be held accountable for breaking the law there. Incitement to violence and conspiracy to commit terrorism are already very illegal. We should not expect (or want) the megacorporations to unilaterally and opaquely enforce these laws, we should expect and want or government to enforce them. This is because when our government enforces them, they have to prove their case in court, and they're accountable to our system of checks and balances; they can't make arbitrary and opaque decisions completely unaccountably like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos can.

 3. It's incitement to violence. 

 • Incitement to violence is illegal. It's a job for our legal system, not Mark Zuckerberg. Also, when you have a platform with user-generated content, in general, we don't consider you legally responsible for what the users write. You can easily find countless incitements to violence on twitter, facebook, and reddit, from both the left and the right. Why isn't the reddit app being removed from the App Store? Why isn't reddit being booted from AWS? Yes, reddit has moderation policies aimed at preventing this content, but they're clearly ineffective. Parler also had moderation policies about it (also clearly ineffective).

 • That's how can you make arbitrary enforcement decisions while pretending to be upholding your policies: if you write a policy that's impossible to adhere to, and then selectively enforce it against only those you don't like. This is what we saw in the Jim Crow south (and continuing to the present day): make a shitload of impossible-to-follow laws, and then only enforce them against black people. That's bad. Fight against this, even when it starts out being used against people you don't like.

 4. But Masterpiece bakery (the gay wedding cake case). 

 • Did you like the outcome of that case? Did you think it correct and good? If not, then why do you think it's correct and good here? That aside, there's not a ton of parallels. I'm extremely against the idea that any business can turn customers away on the basis of their sexual orientation, which was part of the question in that case. But regardless of that, Masterpiece bakery isn't part of an effectively monopoly, as Amazon, Google, and Apple are.

 5. It just means they'll have to communicate another way instead, they're not being prevented from communicating at all. 

 • The past few days have proven this to be the lie it always clearly was. Twitter bans Trump, and people said, ""well, he can just use Parler if we wants."" Trump says something about using Parler, and then the next day, Parler is completely wiped off the Internet.",1610514385.0,1

"I completely agree that the other social media sites are not good. But I don’t see a double standard, I just see a broken system. 

Moderation on social media is inconsistent and that frequently leads to things only getting removed when they receive bad PR. This is a result of these companies not investing enough in moderation resources, something I feel that can be fixed with regulations. If companies were forced to create clear guidelines that were fairly enforced then moderation would be a lot more transparent. 

Moderation is not censorship. It’s an incredibly vital part of how the internet works at the moment

I say all of this because Parler is an example of what happens when you have no moderation policy in place. The result is disturbing to say the least. If Parler can’t be bothered to put forth the bare minimum effort to remove death threats to US politicians ***after*** the Capitol riots, then they are responsible for that content. 

They are not legally responsible due to the protections granted under Section 230, but there are plenty of other forms of responsibility. Amazon bears some responsibility for hosting their content. Amazon deciding that they didn’t want to profit off of such a platform is not censorship. It’s the free market at work. The last time I checked, domestic terrorist wasn’t a protect class in the US. 

Parler openly invited the kind of activity that directly resulted in the attack on the Capitol building. Even after everything happened, they still refused to remove any content or ban any users. While they do not have a legal obligation to do so, I think it’s fair to say that they have a moral obligation.",1610518202.0,-1

"&gt; This case is not about suppressing speech or stifling viewpoints. It is not about a conspiracy to restrain trade. **Instead, this case is about Parler’s demonstrated unwillingness and inability to remove from the servers of Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) content that threatens the public safety, such as by inciting and planning the rape, torture, and assassination of named public officials and private citizens. There is no legal basis in AWS’s customer agreements or otherwise to compel AWS to host content of this nature. AWS notified Parler repeatedly that its content violated the parties’ agreement, requested removal, and reviewed Parler’s plan to address the problem, only to determine that Parler was both unwilling and unable to do so.** AWS suspended Parler’s account as a last resort to prevent further access to such content, including plans for violence to disrupt the impending Presidential transition.

&gt;Despite Parler’s rhetoric, its lawsuit is no more than a meritless claim for breach of contract. But the facts are unequivocal: If there is any breach, it is Parler’s demonstrated failure and inability to identify and remove such content. AWS was well within its rights to suspend Parler immediately for those failures. Parler also cannot hold AWS liable in tort for enforcing the agreement’s express terms. And there is no antitrust claim where, as here, Parler cannot plausibly plead an agreement to cause it harm and the complained-of conduct is undeniably compatible with a legitimate purpose.
**Compelling AWS to host content that plans, encourages, and incites violence would be unprecedented. Parler has no likelihood of prevailing on the merits, and the balance of equities and public interest strongly tip against an injunction.** The motion for a temporary restraining order should be denied.

If FB employees (add corporate infrastructure in the case of Amazon and Google) are put at risk due to political decisions made by management, there are many, many more risks to mitigate than the random actions of complete strangers.

The decision to censor a candidate with the most GOP votes on record (both for and against him) risks enflaming employees just as much as members of the public. The statistics of voting alone indicate that it is very likely that there are many Trump supporters working inside that organization. Given the frequent, vocal criticism of the company against that candidate, it is also very likely that they are hiding their political affiliations from management.

1) Kathy Griffin was suspended for that tweet, and was contacted personally by the Department of Justice. Why wasn't her account suspended permanently? Because she didn't keep posting that content. Trump refused to listen to Twitter after having been warned repeatedly that he had violated their terms of service, so he lost his Twitter account. In regards to MN, can you provide a link that Twitter users were actively organizing an assault on the precinct? I was not able to find that on the first three pages of a Google search. To that point, however, here was Trump's response to the attack. ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!” 

And no, none of the data (outside of rhetorical Conservative outrage) supports the idea that social media discriminates against conservatives. From the Cato Institute:

Conservatives widely believe, despite minimal** [evidence](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/conservative-big-tech-campaign-based-myths-misunderstanding)**, that the big social media platforms are censoring their voices via “shadow banning” or algorithmic bias.

"&gt; Twitter, Facebook, and reddit have those systems in place and are actively monitoring and removing posts like that.

Parler is a private company and can do what it wants. At least that's what Twitter and FB told conservatives when they were suppressing their posts.

Twitter and FB also hide behind Section 230 saying their not responsible for the content posted by their users. So how is it that 230 protects those companies but not Parler then?

If Twitter and FB have content moderation systems in place, then how did several Democratic politicians get away with inciting and promoting the violence, rioting and looting that took place over 100 days in Portland and Seattle as they lay siege to Federal Government buildings? Including the current VP creating a fund to BAIL OUT PEOPLE WHO WERE ARRESTED?!?!?

What was done to THEIR accounts? Nothing, nada, zip, zilch. 

The FBI concluded the planning took place on FB, Twitter and Reddit. What was the response then for them not stopping this from happening? They are FAR MORE culpable then Parler ever was - yet those platforms were left alone while Parler was targeted and taken down by companies who didn't like what they were doing and shut them down. 

Which should be terrifying to anybody running any sort of app or platform. You are now beholden to the companies who rule over you. The message was clear: ""Step out of line and we'll shut you down. Don't do something we agree with? We'll shut you down. Don't do what we tell you to do? We'll shut you down.""

This is a dangerous precedent. All three platforms have dubious and long histories of refusing to remove offensive content. From the girl who livestreamed her own suicide to the military vet who did the same thing. FB REFUSED to take down either content, weeks and months later. Even after heartfelt plea's from their families Their histories of abusing users rights and private information is well known. For years they allowed Jihadi terrorists to post their executions, hanging and tortures without moderating any of it, allowing terrorists to use their platform as a recruiting tool and to incite violence against the US.

Yet, nothing happened to them, EVER. Oh sure, some lame congressional hearings. Did Apple ever remove FB's app from the app store? Nope. Did they remove Twitter's app from the store for the same thing? Nope. Did Amazon ever threaten to remove their hosting because of what they did? Nope.

SCOTUS has ruled that speech not protected is mainly speech that incites immediate lawlessness, which yelling fire in a crowded theater does not do.

Raz Simone who led the insurrection at CHAZ which resulted in plenty of property damage, rape and murder coordinated it through twitter and still has an account too.

All the actors cancelling Parler (amazon, apple, google) published ""In Defense of Looting"" while the riots were running haywire in August. The book describes the tactic as a means to force through the revolution - i.e. insurrection.

When a Trump supporter was assassinated, we saw videos of antifa leaders saying they defended their city from fascism. Joe Biden still refused to condemn them and put the blame on Trump.

I can go on and on. Hell, if you just look at reddit's ""popular"" you'll see calls to violence on a regular basis as long as they're ""fascist"" (i.e. regular Trump supporters). Calls to political violence against a sitting president's supporters is insurrection.

If Capital Hill were done by BLM rioters, it would have looked tame in comparison to all the rest, it would have been called an otherwise peaceful protest marred by police violence, and people would be out for blood for the casualties. Especially the shooting of Ashley Babbit who - unlike most incidents that people riot for - wasn't actually posing any threat to the officer when he shot her in the neck.

in Parler's case, the coordinated denial of service by their providers was not quite as foreseeable - it includes unprecedented contract violations by Amazon AWS

personally I consider TPB a lot more important historically, but these remarks are incredibly biased. From the infrastructure perspective, sites/apps like Parler are A LOT more challenging than TPB. Social media sites have very heavy load and strict requirements in terms of data consistency across nodes. TPB is a lot more static and syncs offsets in the minutes or hours are just fine, which makes scaling sooo much simpler. Also technically TPB is pretty meh, there are so many better sites that simply are not as historically significant because of the court cases and because they were just first",1610607692.0,1

"&gt;I'm a software engineer and I know what I'm talking about.  I've spun up servers on VPSs and AWS/GCP/Azure to host websites and rest api's.  Do you know what you're talking about?

I've been a software engineer for over twenty years. I've deployed *thousands* of containers and VMs to cloud providers. I've worked with all the major cloud providers. I've *managed* a VPS service. I've *built* a caching load balancer.

But here's the thing that will really blow your mind: I've deployed applications without using a cloud provider. &lt;mind exploding.gif&gt; You know what's even crazier? I've done that before and after the existence of cloud providers. 

&gt;AWS is the generators and comcast/spectrum/at&amp;t are the power lines. You need to declare both utilities. 

No, that's where you go silly.

The Internet exists without AWS and cloud providers. It existed before them, and they continue to host a minority of the websites. AWS/GCP/Azure are far more important as the backoffices of a respectable number of corporations, rather than as a simple webhost. Again: It's not an access provider, its just virtualizing your datacenter. 

&gt;And obviously you don't have much experience in software development because you only think in terms of universal access to the internet (client side). 

It appears you haven't been a software developer very long because you conflate software development and network architecture, but I suppose that's common for people who never actually had to think about the realities of their hardware/network.

Here's the thing: If you can't think of how to deploy a fairly simple web application (by all accounts Parler is pretty simple: basic three-tier app with the only complications coming from enhanced auth and an identity confirmation service) without a cloud provider, then you don't know as much as you think you do. Loads and loads of developers *today* are deploying web applications to multiple private data centers and updating private servers in locations around the world to create their own resilient apps with geo-routed caching proxies. Apparently you're not familiar with how to do that. That feels like a bit of a knowledge gap to me, but that's fine.

What's not fine is you then declaring that cloud providers must be handled as utilities because you don't know how to do stuff without them. 

Of course it all makes sense when you say:

&gt;These tech companies already tried to silence wikileaks, now they've come after a sitting president 

So, its not about actually benefiting everyone so much as them not helping the people you like. Understand that the reason that is happening is because wikileaks and Parler were *violating the law* in the country that those companies were operating in. With Parler in particular, the speech being used would have required Amazon to report the service to the Secret Service and FBI repeatedly.

So, it seems your primary motivation in this debate is to protect the ability for people to distribute hate speech, to distribute verbal threats, and to coordinate potential terrorist activities. That's why we need to nationalize virtual datacenters. Because apparently racist political extremists aren't familiar with fairly simple network architecture and how to deploy it.

Then you move people over to the new system.  I've been doing that since the DotCom first started.  Moving people from Novel to Microsoft servers, from MS to Oracle, you get about 50 million in funding and you can buy some pretty smart people.

It's not like Amazon has some patent on a workable feature set.  There's other players in the field and server farms have been around for quite a while now, it's not like the early days of the Internet where people can't even build a web page.  This tech is old and stable, has been for a long time and Amazon isn't the only player.  In addition schools have been teaching this for over a decade now, not many secrets on how to build a server and the features are more open source that ever before.

Can't see this taking a year, just gotta hire the right people.  You're suggesting that nobody other than Amazon knows how to build a server?  Amazon's big but plenty of others know how to build a server farm.  Even FB open sourced theirs years ago.  It's also not a heavy use like a Netflix, it's just text and pics.

&gt;Also you Seem to believe that AWS customers have 40% ""Other Views"", which they definetly dont.

Actually I don't think that at all.  What I think is that 40% of the US doesn't see that what Twitter, FB, Amazon and others are doing is right.  In fact, it's greater than 40%, but not all of them would use another platform.  It's call free speech and there's some piece of paper somewhere in DC that talks about it.


&gt;The reason why Amazon AWS is sooo big and seemingly indestructible, is because its Not Just ""throw some Servers in a room""....

I'm not suggesting to ""throw some Servers in a room"" and the reason for Amazon being so big is how they do their business.  They don't have competition in their base business.  However, that's not the point.  You're suggesting that nobody other than Amazon can build a server farm?  Anyone can and several have.  The real point is that Parler has a built in customer... Parler.

This is a chance for Parler to raise $100 million and build out their own platform, and they should.  One thing that Amazon needs is competition.

The real underlying point is that Amazon, FB, Twitter and others have silenced others.  They've done this to newspapers that ended up telling the truth.  This isn't supposed to happen and they have been given special right that others don't have.",1610634912.0,1

So, if Parler wants to exist they will have to do more to moderate their content (which is why the service exists to begin with) or they'll have to create their own solution not relying on other companies - probably a difficult option due to the need for collaboration with other companies (Apple/Google to list apps and such, backbone internet, etc).",1610637699.0,-1

Businesses are allowed to refuse service for any reason, as long as that reason is not based on a person's race, gender, religion, or disability. Unless that state or City has a law that says otherwise, businesses are well within their legal rights to deny a gay couple service. I don't personally agree with it, but it is the law, and I would just boycott that business until the law is updated. 

AWS has hosted services found to have illegal and otherwise unsavoury things on it. Those services were also terminated when amazon was made aware of it, I'm sure. AWS TOS also allows companies operating on them some leeway in that regard. As long as the company being hosted makes an effort to moderate their content, the service does not violate AWS TOS. Parlor either made no effort, or very little effort to moderate their illegal and unsavoury content, and was subsequently removed for that TOS violation. 

This is a private matter between two businesses. If it even makes it to the california supreme court, I would be shocked. Parlor violated their hosting services terms of service. They were cut off from that service as stipulated in the TOS. Open and shut case. And parlor is more than welcome to seek funding for their own Server solutions, or find hosting elsewhere.

The courts have repeatedly rejected attempts to limit the reach of Section 230 to ""traditional"" Internet service providers, instead treating many diverse entities as ""interactive computer service providers.""*

"TL;DR answer is it depends heavily on how well you build your business for it, and the extent of the destruction. Disaster recovery is significantly easier when leveraging a host like AWS, since they have the capacity to really only have small outages in specific regions. In most cases like that, your critical business operations are running in multiple regions, so the chance of a full destruction are basically zero. 

Most of our apps have architecture defined in Kubernetes, so you just need to instruct whatever provider to execute it and everything _mostly_ handles itself, though there are differences in service networking and execution between different providers that need to be accounted for. Again, in our case, we build to be able to run on at least 3 different hosts (AWS, Azure, Google) for critical applications so that stuff is minimized. 

Anything that's not containerized like this, we have scripts to build servers from scratch to automate everything as much as possible, and the software itself handles architecture management. For instance, one app has a management application and several node applications that communicate through an API accessible on a VPN network. For recovery, we build the former, point DNS to it, then build the latter which automatically register themselves with the former as part of their startup process, and the former can begin managing them.

Biggest point of pain we have with recovery is data. Everything we have takes nightly backups at minimum and stores them in various places, so we can basically guarantee &lt; 24h loss of data. Anything critical backs up more often. However, moving terabytes/petabytes of data over to a **new host** takes a significant amount of time. While we can get our services up and running on a new host incredibly quickly, they can't really do anything until that data is in place (in some cases, many are designed around generating non-conflicting data, so we can just merge in the old stuff while the service is running). I think the last time we timed it we could have our critical apps up and running within minutes with old data brought in within a few hours, but the lesser used stuff could take upwards of 24 hours.

This is likely Parler's biggest pain right now, since from what I've read they have nearly triple digit terabytes of data. I don't know if they can access that or not with how Amazon basically just terminated their service, so I can't speak to that. So they basically need to find a host that will actually accept them, migrate everything, adjust everything to start on the new host, then deal with issues that arise with increasing load due to host differences (for instance, in my experience, private networking on AWS is significantly better and higher performance than other hosts, which could cause capacity issues on a new host).

Given what I've seen on what they exposed in their APIs, among other things, I doubt they planned for this at all nor did they build their systems to minimize any sort of outage like this.",1610654410.0,-1

So when a leftist says ""I support BLM"", its like yea sure, of course you do, and you'll support every other left leaning group and idea, that's not ""liberal"", that's just agreeing with things you already like.  Liberal would be agreeing with the ability of others to speak their minds, particularly those who you disagree with.

&amp;#x200B;

So why do we have free speech, I mean it can offend people, it can lead to terrible ideas, it can lead to violence, what could possibly be the upside to free speech, that is so great that it out weighs all of the negatives?  Well, for starters no 1 is omniscient.  The way that you are able to perceive reality, is through limited senses &amp; cognitive ability.  For instance, you can't look behind you and in front of you, you can only focus on 1 thing at a time.  [Human perception looks like this](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gifer.com%2FTGgc.gif&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fgifer.com%2Fen%2FTGgc&amp;tbnid=k2mV2rzRlpEt8M&amp;vet=12ahUKEwjU2oHNop7uAhVGHVkKHVzVBu8QMygBegUIARCEAg..i&amp;docid=81xMwoa8R35_XM&amp;w=320&amp;h=240&amp;q=spot%20lights%20gif&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjU2oHNop7uAhVGHVkKHVzVBu8QMygBegUIARCEAg), the spotlight is 1 person looking around in the darkness.  Well the question is, what is the most important thing to pay attention too?  Well everyone of course will be able to positively say, what they are looking at is the most important thing \[that is why they are looking at it\].  You need opposing views to enable people to compare and contrast their views to help find the best way through the darkness \[unknown\].  The cost is that some views will be wrong and die out, but its only the view that dies, and not the human.  When you remove peoples ability to communicate to 1 another their different views, you remove the ability to find the best way forward, or most important thing to look at.  So when unify all views to be exactly the same, eliminating those you disagree with, you then lose the ability for the idea to die, and replace it with the ability for the human to die.    

&amp;#x200B;

So what's the big deal with big tech?  who cares, they are a business, not a government, their servers they can do what they want right?  That's just capitalism at work right?  No, not really.  First of all, all businesses in the USA are held accountable for their actions.  You have OSHA, EPA, FDA, etc. then you also have legal repercussions \[ie if the news runs a hit piece on you, you can sue them for damages\].  Big tech does not have any of these regulations, they are 100% above any and all laws thanks to section 230, which enables them to operate more like a place of public domain, IE a public square, rather then a place of business or technically rather then a publisher \[like any news source is considered a publisher\].  Except in addition to being above the law, they have all the powers of a publisher, meaning they can decide what is and is not on their website.  This gives them all the power in the information age.  They get to change what people look at, they get to decide where all the spot lights are going, 1 small group of unelected people, operating on what they think is best, good intentions mostly.

&amp;#x200B;

You might say, well people can build their own platform, and the answer is a resounding no, they can't, anyone who does will simply be labeled a terrorist, thus unfit, and all big tech will follow suit, IE Parlor.    You might say that its no big deal, you can say what you want in public, or in private, and the answer there is a resounding no.  First of all, you don't know if you'll be doxed online, lose your job and such, so better stay quiet.  Secondly, lets say you have 100 friends on Facebook, and those 100 friends have 100 friends each, when you post something, you affect 100 different people in some form or another \[that's just how society works, I am having an affect on you, just as you are having an affect on me, and everyone in this forum is affecting one another\].  That means you are only 2 people away from affecting 100 million people.    That's the power of social media at the moment, stripping all that power into the hands of the few is going to yield catastrophic results, as it completely undermines the whole point of free speech, in the name of the dangers of free speech, using the worst aspect of humanity, which I would say is the ability to demonize our human enemies, thus providing the self-justification of any action against them.

&amp;#x200B;

One needs to realize that society itself is indeed tyrannical in nature.  We constantly give each other signals, whether it be verbal or just through body language, what sort of behavior we like, and dislike.  This is how formation of governments have come to be, you have a society that operates on a set of beliefs, that society then puts those beliefs to paper, then the government sets the rules, and enforces those beliefs.  So when the west was rising, and the whole enlightenment was happening, the birth of ""liberal"" views \[and I mean in a western sense, not an American sense, which means conservatives in America are considered liberal as well\]. The concept was to stop any entity from being so tyrannical that it could completely prevent any competing views.  It was a self realization of ideology essentially, and a vow against being blinded by it.  Now we just have businesses capable of being bigger then society itself.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do we do about it?  Not only does big tech control algorithms of what you see, giving birth to hedonistic echo chambers, which is a big problem, as noted by the left leaning documentary recently posted on Netflix \[although they only critique the conservatives, while ignoring their own potential failures\].  But who should police the public squares, should it be big tech?  It is their servers after all.  I think not, I think they should only profit from ad revenue, and perhaps a sub fee if really need be.  We as humans came up with this idea of a state monopoly on violence, AKA the police which means the police protect the law and order, and then judges get to judge whether a law was broken, and that's the system we should follow for online as well.  Perhaps it will need tweaking, after all the chances we get such an important matter done right on the first try is infinitesimally low, and it is essentially a global service so we have major hurdles to come up with.  But ultimately, big tech companies like Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple, should decide whether they want to be a publisher or a public forum.  If they decide to be a publisher they should be responsible for everything on their servers, meaning if a pedophile puts up child porn they would be legally responsible as well as the pedophile, with the liability and accountability, they would then have the power to censor what ever speech they wanted on their platform, as they are the ones who would be held accountable for it.  Alternatively, they can decide to be a public forum, this means they abdicate all liability and accountability for what is on their servers.  The liability becomes that of those who post, but this also means that they cannot moderate the public forum.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, this is to not have the supreme power of information solely in the hands of big business, while sharing none of the liability for what their power grants.",1610727123.0,1
"I'd like to also add that Amazon employs some of the best developers out there to manage their web services division. Parler on the other hand, sequentially names their videos leaving them open to public access even after they're ""taken down"" by the author. I have a friend who's been in development for awhile and he said parler's method is, ""laughably junior"". Sequentially naming things on a social media site is just asking for privacy problems.

It seems like that would have been useful for their arguments now if they hadnt gotten rid of it....

But now that it's biting the republicans in the ass they want to stop? Too late for that. 

So let me get this straight, your answer is to punish the conservatives with what you thought they did wrong, by repeating the same exact actions?   If you can recognize that they did something wrong, wouldn't it be beneficial to society to not repeat said action?  This just comes off as entirely resentful and revenge seeking.

&gt;If someone does something wrong they should have to deal with the consequences. Calling it cancel culture just serves to impowers those who have done something wrong. 

Who gives those consequences?  Who judges them?  The lynch mob?  That's ridiculous,, again we have a state monopoly on violence for a reason, and that reason is because there is no reasoning with a lynch mob.  A major flaw here is that all humans are imperfect, and can bring upon themselves the anger of society, the answer shouldn't be to completely excommunicate that person from society, there needs to be some compassion and forgiveness, because without that you'll have nothing but executions.  Whats worse, is it will be entirely bias'd executions as well.  Like Sarah Jeong who was hired as a NY Times editor, after it came to light that she was advocating for the genocide of all white people on Twitter, to which NYT had defended her.   The point here is that society can be tyrannical, but its the people who control the flow of information that dictate what society is going to be outraged about, and thus decides how the tyranny of society should be directed.  Currently big tech has a monopoly on the free flow of information, with 0 accountability, and that is unacceptable.  It used to be that the left would condemn so much power in the hands of a business, and like I said, the left is currently embracing the extremists on the left who find that sort of behavior acceptable as long as it isnt against them.  AKA Illiberas.",1610729206.0,-1

It has been frustrating watching T get fact checked and fact checked, (mostly well deserved), but other politicians are not treated the same.

It made people desperate, they felt that their voice was taken away.

But mostly that didn't happen. People felt desperate, then parler was shut down ""for allowing post calling for violence"", but at the same time twitter was trending ""hxxg Mike pence"" why is amazon not dropping twitter for allowing calls for violence on their platform?


I want there to be fair treatment. Censoring people who you disagree with doesn't change their opinions, right or wrong, it just keeps them out of your sight and makes them scared and desperate. Scared and desperate people lash out, feeling no other recourse is open to them.

"ITT no one reads the article or understands the history, just regurgitates catch phrases.

In 2013 Amazon was part of the DOJ anti-trust suit against the Big 5 publishers. It was proven that the Big 5 publishers, along with Apple, formed a cartel to force a certain pricing model and raises prices.

Amazon did not want the Agency model, publishers responded by pulling their books from Amazon.

"I think I get what your saying, but I don't think it works like that in practice.

Data sitting on servers is data. Data being displayed on the web is content. Not all content is the same. There's mundane text, video, copyrighted video, torrent/pirate, porn, top secret data, personal info, etc..., and, depending on the type and country, AWS may be on the hook legally for hosting it.

The contract Amazon gave Parler specified no violent/threatening content.  It could have been related to laws somewhere, or just a choice. Doesn't matter. Parler chose to sign it, and took a hands-off approach to moderation (26000 queued items last Saturday).

Keep in mind that AWS is fairly recent, and not required for having a site like Parler. In the old days, you'd just get some servers and rack space and build it yourself. Nothing is stopping them from using another cloud service or creating something from scratch. 

Parler has no right to use Amazon's services the way Parler wants to, with no checks and balances.

&gt; Unions are a prominent presence at Amazon in Europe, but the company for years successfully fought off labor organizing efforts in the U.S. The last vote on unionization at the company happened in 2014, when a small group of maintenance and repair techs at a Delaware warehouse voted against joining the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.

&gt; Amazon has said that between March and mid-September, it employed almost 1.4 million front-line workers across Amazon and Whole Foods in the United States.

"Yeah I've no idea of all the details, but if Amazon had their choice they would sell books more like Steam sells games.  I've easily bought over 100 games from Steam that I've never even installed because the games were so cheap.  That results in more total revenue, however, as I'd never have bought those games without the greatly reduced price.

The ebook business could easily be ran the same way.  Cut the prices by 50% and total volume goes up by more than 2x which means more money for everyone.  That strategy would totally destroy the physical book business however.

I mean, people didn’t leave Reddit because their cat posts were being deleted; they left because r/The_Dictator was quarantined. So it seems unlikely that those people went to Parler to post more cat pics. They went to post things that they couldn’t post on Reddit. That’s the problem with all these sites; once they become known for hosting racist and Nazi content they become overwhelmed by it because there are a dearth of places that tolerate it.

He was upset that Biden was the nominee despite the fact that a majority of voters (and not superdelegates) nominated him.

" Amazon moved to expel Parler from its servers after finding the company in breach of contract for failing to identify and remove posts by users that called for the “rape, torture, and assassination” of elected officials, police officers, and public school teachers, according to a recent court filing. 

 Parler is among the apps that attendees used to stage the event. While others, including Facebook, are viewed as responsible for not taking more aggressive action against extremist rhetoric on their platforms, Parler’s policies openly condoned the racist rhetoric espoused by many of the rioters—and the conspiracy theories that fueled their attack that ended in five deaths. Pulling Parler’s plug was a “last resort,” Amazon said, to prevent further access to such content, including what it called fresh plans for violence “to disrupt the impending Presidential transition.”",1610767668.0,-1
"The assertion is more that the data is likely sensationalized to get those delicious clicks, especially where Gizmodo is concerned. 

I went ahead and spent a click to check it out. First few paragraphs are restating the premise of the headline and the possibility of dire consequences associated.

Then the hard numbers...

“In total, Gizmodo found that 16 Parler videos were filmed within 50 feet of 10 different local law enforcement buildings, according to GPS data tied to the footage; 39 videos were filmed within 1,000 feet of domestic military facilities; and another 64 were filmed within 500 feet of the entrance of an immigrant detention center. Five additional videos were filmed within 1,000 feet of overseas military bases.”

Not exactly mind blowing. They didn’t even go into cross referencing those with posts made from the Capitol riot.

Sure, I was not clear there. If I recall correctly, Amazon stopped hosting them because their administration didn't comply with their requests. That makes sense.

"I don't think your first point is valid.  Its a common point I hear being made here, but it obviously fails to capture the true nuance of whats going on right now with big-tech censorship.  

for instance, In the past if Walmart didn't want me to spout my ideas in their store, then I would have to take my language to the street, or to the bar, and say it there.  That was their right, if they want to exercise it on their land.  But now a-days, it would be as if Walmart owned every piece of land all the way to the arctic circle.  And they said ""sure! Have your ideas, but you cant say them on our land!  Im afraid you'll have to leave"" and as a result I'm out there alone on the north pole speaking to nobody.  

When free speech laws were designed we never foresaw companies having *this much* of a monopoly on the dissemination of information, we thought only government could hold that much power, and we really need to revisit these laws in order to protect one of our best methods of finding truth.

Don't think the antarctica analogy is accurate? Look what happened to Parler.  We all said, ""sure if theres a market for a more free speech oriented internet forum then one will emerge."" And one did! and it was successful until Google took it off the play store, apple took it off the app store, and amazon refused to provide server space.  Even if Parler were to find a way to exist Google could hide it from search results with ease, they control virtually all internet traffic. Thats monopolistic and dangerous and both liberals and conservatives alike should be concerned with it!

With regards to the Galileo example, and Epstein example, they were merely used to convey the idea that the mainstream narrative can be wrong at times, and that the free dissemination of information can open us up to new truths.  If need be one can come up with a million other examples given that those two weren't satisfactory.  

My final point is that we've now exchanged different ideas about free speech, and I know that through writing this reply I've gotten a better handle on what my own ideas are and what a counter idea might look like, and thats awesome! That helps us refine our worldview.

Now, everyone magically has a good view of Twitter, Facebook, etc. Some people are unironically praising them for the move, as if we didn't just have like 3 months long of rioting in Summer that was primarily organised on Twitter and Facebook by thousands of out in the open left wing accounts, that were all very, very easy to find because they literally fucking posted in the same two hashtags for months - #BLM, #Antifa.

"Your comment reads like it was made to one of my other comments in this chain, where I explained this very thing. The basic idea is that the people who come together on Parler are those who need an echo chamber very bad or those whose beliefs are so extreme that they get banned on Twitter or other platforms. Despite what right wingers like to claim, it's actually pretty hard to get banned on Twitter even if you are right wing. Twitter doesn't target the right, it targets people spreading hate and violence.

Now twitter is of course biased, there is no doubt about it. But the general idea holds true for any platform. You have the some on the Left. Very rarely do you see People spending their day advocating for a violent communist revolution or talking about killing the rich. It's because these people would get banned too. They too have their own platforms like Parler. Platforms that cater specifically to the radical and extreme. These platforms often claim to be about free speech but the reality is more often than not that opposing ideas are heavily moderated against. A less extreme but comparable analogue would be the various right and left subreddits. Specifically the ones that claim to welcome discussion and value free speech but end up banning people with opposing ideas for dubious reasons anyway. You can find people on Reddit whose ideas are to extreme for Twitter and you can find people whose ideas are too extreme for Reddit on platforms like Parler or voat.

This perceived censorship against the right is neither actual censorship nor is it targeted specifically at the right. Rather it is targeted at individuals whose ideas are rejected by the broader society, people who threaten society, talk about how much they hate it and spread this hate or advocate for violence. It's targeted at Fringe beliefs that are going against the general moral compass of society (or community, if you want to call it that. Would fit if , for example, one would look only at twitter rather than all of society) as a whole. As for why it's not censorship, well speech isn't really restricted is it? Twitter doesn't break into peoples houses and prevents them from talking about certain topics. It's de-platforming. People are de-platformed from Twitter/Facebook/Reddit but still free to speak whatever they want, on different platforms. And this is well within the rights of a platform. 

I personally think we are at a point where Social networks of the size of Twitter and Facebook need to be considered as something closer to a public service, which would then (depending on the exact ruling) possibly make it illegal to ban people for political beliefs. But as long as Twitter and co are still private companies, it is very well in their right to decide who can and who can't speak on their platform. 

I like to compare this to a party. Imagine you have a party at your house. 100 people are there and have a good time. 5 of them, however, are constantly shit talking you, your house, everyone else and occasionally mention that they'd like to see everything here burned down. One of them eventually starts to actually smash your stuff, 2 others cheer them on, the remaining two just stand there in silence. Would you throw them out? Of course you would At the very least the one smashing your stuff. Maybe you've seen this before, you know that the two idiot who cheered him on are very likely to go smash something soon to, so you throw them out too. They do nothing but detract from the party, they actively insult everyone there, are openly hostile to the very concept of your party. Why would you tolerate them there? And it's your right to kick them out of your home. It's your private property after all. 

But if this same party was thrown by the government, things would be different. Now there is a serious question of whether or not throwing them out is actually censorship. For this basic example, let's assume that being thrown out of the party by the government means you end up in Prison) or get a fine, same concept, just less severe). 

When they are thrown out of your party in your private house, they can simply go to the party next door or return home and throw their own party with blackjack and hookers. But when the government throws them out, they can't just go somewhere else that easily. The government will stop them, force them to pay their fine/go to prison. 

That's the difference between de-platforming and censorship. And that party those 5 guys organise at their own home? That's Parler. And there are dozens of other smaller parties all over town made by similar groups wit different beliefs. They all have in common that they are hostile towards the big parties. Though they do also attract people who aren't *that* hostile (like those two who just stood by and watched the others smash stuff). Also note that they aren't thrown out for *thinking* this way. Not even necessarily for speaking of it. Only when they start to bother and annoy or even threaten other people they will be thrown out. So they can hate the party as much as they want and still stay and even complain about the party. They just have to dial down their language and tone. Then, people still won't like them. They will most likely get annoyed looks when they complain about the party, but nobody will throw them out, because they don't bother anyone that much.

Also note that when those 5 guys go throw their own party, they claim that this party will be different. They state that everyone is welcome there. But of course they too will throw out people that bother or threaten them. But they likely don't share quite the same definition of ""bothering someone"". To them, maybe stating that their party is shit is already extremely bothering. 

Again, you can do the same thought experiment with the government thrown party, where they can't simply go elsewhere. It's immediately obvious that the situation is very different. But it should also be very obvious that it makes sense to throw people out that bother or threaten the party. Even for the government, but the Government has to be held to way higher standards than you because the consequences of being thrown out of the government party are so much worse. With a private party, you can be fairly lax and throw people as soon as you are pretty sure that they will eventually smash something. But the Government shouldn't be allowed to throw anyone out *before* they smash something. Or rather, as most governments handle it, at the very least there has to be substantial evidence that they were actively planning and intending to smash something. It's a thin line and surely nothing new for you. It's the same old slippery slope between freedom of speech and preventing terrorism. Private Parties just get a lot more leeway and freedom because the consequences are very minor. 

I mentioned before how I think that large social networks should perhaps be treated as public services. That's because the consequences of being banned from twitter may not actually be all that minor. It may very well spell the end for a small independent journalists career. So I think these large social networks deserve to be held to a higher standard than sites like Parler. But again, not the case currently, so Twitter is completely in their right to ban whoever they want. And really, at this point we have to blame ourselves for becoming dependent on Twitter and other such networks. It's not like this is something new. They have always had TOS and they have always enforced them more or less consistently. For the same reason every sucessful YouTuber will recommend you to never rely on YouTube ads as your only source of income. YouTube can and probably will at some point fuck you over. That is something to be expected and if it happens and you lose everything, you quite frankly only have yourself to blame. 

Now as for the whole Parler stuff, I haven't looked into the specifics here so I'll be brief but the situation is a bit different. Parler may have had service contracts with Amazon and other companies and if so and they didn't break contract terms, Parler may have and definitely should pursue a legal settlement. There is no binding contract between Twitter and it's users but there very well would be between Parler and it's web hosting service provider.",1610817612.0,1

"“yet no one on the right has ever thought to create a social network to compete with the current big players.”

Kind of seems ironic to say that when the subject at hand was an attempt at that. 

“the internet isn't controlled by the Left. Nothing stops someone from making a new, actually free platform.”

While I will agree that the left doesn’t “control” the internet, there are certainly heavy hitters that lean socially left. The thing that stopped them from creating a new free platform was Apple and Google removing Parler from their app stores. Not to mention, Amazon pulled access to their servers when Parler didn’t change their ToS to Amazon’s liking. 

There’s a big misconception that Parler was refusing to take down posts instigating violently storming the capitol. The reality is, Parler’s moderation team was made up primarily of human staff and didn’t remove posts through the use of algorithms. Which, I feel that if someone is trying to make a platform that sticks to free speech principles, algorithmically removing content fails to judge the nuance and context of a post. As I understand it, Parler was removing violent posts, as instigating violence is not protected by free speech. However without automatically removing posts they didn’t have the manpower to keep up with what was happening.

I think it’s wrong that Apple and Google removed Parler from their app stores as punishment for “causing” the storming of the capitol. If this standard were applied evenly, Facebook would be removed (which I would also disagree with) for being used to plan the violent protests of this summer. I feel that if Parler sticks to its principles, it’s closer to a true platform than most other options available.

“the left somehow ends up getting de-platformed from it.”

I haven’t heard cases of the left being de-platformed, but I guess I wouldn’t be surprised as many people today treat their political “opponents” as lesser than their own group. A lot of the societal and other social problems that have arisen recently are a result of this behavior. 

For example the “would you punch a (insert evil group from history)” scenario, but then claiming your political “opponent” is that evil group to justify violence against them.

Despite having said all of this, I think the creation of more and more social media networks is more likely to cause division than unification. One of the problems is that people will often flock to others that share their ideas, thus creating echo chambers for themselves. That’s how you end up with so many people that were once moderate hating the other side. That’s why so many people aren’t willing to compromise to solve anything. Everyone now believes that their solution is infallible and that anyone who disagrees is an idiot. I feel that the more social media platforms there are, the easier it is for people to isolate themselves from anyone different than them.

While I understand that a blocking feature is needed for the cases of harassment and other abuse, it’s often misused to block anything you don’t like. I was on twitter recently, and saw that they added a feature that allowed for the blocking of specific words and phrases. In some situations it could be positive, but I have a feeling it will generally be used by people to block words and ideas that differ from their own.

Between the problems I’ve listed above and the general willingness of people to be more rude online than in person, there are a lot of flaws in social media as it stands. I think that instead of feeling the need to make a new platform for everyone to agree on, there should be some changes to allow for more discussion, disagreement, and other sharing of ideas.",1610831628.0,-1

you seem to misunderstand due to the media misrepresenting something. Amazon as a company did not pay taxes because they reinvested all their profits into building the business and got credit for their losses once they turned a profit. Even small businesses do this.

These two statements contradict each other. Just because at the time their moderator team comprised of volunteers did not mean they were not a moderator team. If your standard is that they aren't a moderator team because they are not paid - that's a shitty standard. 

Either way, it should also be noted that earlier this month the WSJ reported that Parler not only expanded its moderation team to 600 people - but also started paying them. It was also hiring full-time employees dedicated just to moderation.

Unless you count being a domestic terrorist as a religion or disability, then you can't say that amazon was in the wrong here. Legally and morally. Amazon is under no obligation to give these terrorists a platform to speak on. They are welcome to find another vendor who can tolerate insurection. 

Now, should Amazon have this much power? No, it should be curtailed and have some kind of third party oversight. But are they wrong to use it here? I don't think so.

"Apart from the others said: You got reviews. 

if someone is selling crap, they'll be getting bad reviews. 


And horse tranquilizer would just be sold under the correct name ketamine. 


You can also buy drug testing kits on Amazon to check that your MDMA is actually MDMA and not just amphetamine.


Same for checking whether heroin is contaminated with fentanyl.

Which is actually very noticeably different: The darknet stuff is nearly never contaminated with fentanyl, whereas real life smugglers virtually uave to use fentanyl to get larger quantities safely into and through your country of residence.



I mean there's still definetely fuckups, there was some news report a couple of years back, where a vendor (or rather the Chinese chem corp messed up the delivery adresses.

So the person expecting some kind of MDMA derivative instead got a back of Acetylfentanyl. 

And being dumb and not sticking to safe use rules, just took the 200 mg dose that would be correct for the MDMA derivative, rather than the under 10mg he'd have to take as an opioid naive person.

So he basically took 20 times the dose that would have gotten him really high and he ODd.



But it's not like that doesn't frequently happen with local dealers either, when they mess up the cutting with fentanyl, and you got hotspots in the powder that are pure fentanyl.

Like even back before fentanyl was a thing, people would die from dealers getting higher than usually quality heroin.


Just remembered a news article back when I was in highschool of the neighbouring cities police saying to please be careful with the current batch of heroin, as it was 20% diamorphine rather than the common 10% in street level products.




Either way, if it's fake or something innocuous as ketamine, you just write a bad review and complain to the shop.

And you obviously don't buy 500 USD+ worth of product from a new vendor.

So if you read this entire article it deals with your points very clearly. What annoys me is when people like you hear a case like “gay wedding cake” and think they understand the issue-such as “it’s ok to refuse service based on someone being gay”... it’s not, and quite simply the Supreme Court upheld that you can’t discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender, what they did say is that this was a very narrow ruling dealing with this one specific case and that balancing a shop owners first amendment right the state commission showed hostility toward it, and therefore they were reversing it. In the cases since that time, they have upheld the premise that you can’t discriminate based on sexual orientation. Soooo. Nice try, but you get no cookie, you are incorrect Again.

Now back onto your original point before you made your incorrect argument, can or should a company be able to shut down a competitor company on an expedited basis when they don’t agree with their political beliefs. If we start from a public good perspective the answer should be no, if Amazon deems that Black Lives Matter is inciting a riot and is using (insert service here) and deplatforms them because of it - is that ok. What if it is politically oriented speech which gets held in a special regard under the law.  If other companies which provide vital services can at their whim, without oversight, without process or recourse do it in on an arbitrary basis, it shows a market which is anti competitive and non functioning. It’s bad business from Amazon, Twitter and all the others, and bad public policy as well. It will and should invite a lawsuit from parlor, it should invite new legislation which introduces regulation and strips protection from the companies which they rely upon today. Your entire argument is centered on companies can do whatever they want as they private businesses and can deem when the terms of service apply and when they don’t, since Twitter right now has deaths threats against a public figure, hosts leaders from foreign governments which threaten the US and allies alike but the elected president of the US gets banned? It’s arbitrary and serves to shut down political speech because they don’t agree with it.

"Think of what's involved in getting those servers up and running.

You can't just hook them into an existing network that isn't set up for it - it needs to be isolated from everything else that the agency is running, because you're giving access to a group of people from outside the agency (and in fact, it's a group that you explicitly don't trust.) Such isolation is not easy to set up. Then you need the servers themselves; you typically don't just have idle capacity lying around to use for something like this if you weren't prepared for it in advance. Then there's the whole matter of infrastructure; we don't know how Parler was built, but this kind of thing needs load balancers, monitoring, failure management, databases with redundancy, possibly a CDN or at least some sort of caching layer. All of this is possible given enough advanced preparation, but I doubt there was an existing team in a government agency whose job it was to set up a cloud provider that's ready to go at a moment's notice. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Cloudflare all employ thousands of (highly paid) skilled engineers to build and maintain the cloud infrastructure that is offered to clients - how is the government just going to spin that up out of the blue?

Oh right, and they have to do it without it looking like a government job even to the people at Parler who are going to be setting up the services, because while I believe the argument that the CEO could be pressured into compliance and silence, the technical people would need to be under the same conditions as well. And once you've got a dozen people who know a secret, it becomes a lot easier for one of them to anonymously leak it because they know how hard it's going to be to identify which individual did it.

To further illustrate the point: think of how much of a shitshow it was at the beginning of the pandemic. The government couldn't even get a website up that showed a graph of new cases without buckling under the load. Or how the healthcare.gov launch went. Parler is a significantly harder technical challenge than healthcare.gov.",1610978066.0,-1

Okay, so you have IAM roles which you could definitely backup up in your repo (as one should). Then what? IAM is for interAWS services and not much more. It’s for access when you are logged in, actually getting logged in is Cognito. 

I could go on and on about how creating an endpoint for each possible transition ability just continues to create security holes where people could decrypt user logins, widen cyber security flaws by giving a key to the kingdom to other companies that may become breached, etc. but chances are that you’ll still be mad/sad and make another statement about something you again don’t understand like “but I got a spare key created at Walmart” or something.

"Maybe I'm not reading the write publications, but DAE find it weird that:

1. Amazon had access to, and had seen, conversations/plans pertaining to the events of Jan 6 Capitol and beyond? 

2. Did not archive *any* of these potentially criminal activities 

3. Did not provide any relevant federal LEO with an archive for those agencies to determine their threat-level (because, presumably, see: # 2

4. The first public mention of the sorts of chatter Parler tolerated--if not outright promoted/coordinated via its algorithm--comes about b/c Amazon announced removing Parler from its server. But no archival actions are taken on the part of Amazon. At least, none they publicly mention. 

5. The violent, government overthrow ""big picture"" intent of the various fascist elements who used Parler as a planning/discussion app for Jan 6 (and beyond) are only made public b/c of the anonymous the hacked archive. That is who the showed connections amongst Jan 6 ringleaders, along with their planning, coordination, tactics, etc., in addition to potential future attacks.

Not Parler. Not Amazon. Not the MSM. Not LEO.

But what about ALL the pounts on the way *before* an anonymous hacker ""gets  lucky""? Namely, *AMAZON*. They could have archived or, turned it over to LEO, scored hella brownie points to boost its image, but that's not what it does. It simply takes Parler offline with no regard to the life-threatening, social upheaval Parler was fostering and that Amazon KNEW Parler was fostering.

"&gt;**""If you don't fight like hell you aren't going to have a country anymore!""** -Outgoing President Donald J. Trump speaking to supporters *just before* the capitol was assaulted and 5 people were killed.

Rhetoric like that is exactly what emboldens those people to take violent action. The guy they voted for is standing directly in front of them, and pleading for them to overturn the fair election he just lost - by any means necessary. His supporters are free to disagree with Biden, they are free to commiserate, they are free to discuss productive, non-violent means of fixing the nation. what they aren't being allowed to do, is to get together on the internet and plan a violent coup, or terrorist attacks. the bottom line is that we share a nation with a handful of dumb folks who worship Trump/guns, and who are prone to violence.. the best thing we can try to do in the short term (while trying to fix our broken education system long-term) is to make sure they can't easily plot to assassinate Nancy Pelosi, Mike Pence, or AOC because the guy they voted for is a sore loser with a big mouth and no moral compass.. 

all of a sudden the free market that MAGA loves so much is cancelling them for their seditious actions and calls for violence, and the snowflakes act like their rights are being trampled because they can't use their favorite social media platform to form a right-wing militia anymore. free speech is important, but we have to use our brains and draw a line between ""free speech"" and ""stupid BS lies and fearmongering that are going to get people killed"". The important thing to remember is that it isn't the government who're pulling the plug, it's Amazon/Apple etc. reacting to the blowback caused by the failed coup attempt, and keeping their investors from fleeing en masse because of bad PR.

"I'm not a law enforcement agency either. But say I'm a landlord--I'm a layman open to correction, but that's what I see Amazon's cloud server business to be: a digital landlord with digital real estate your digital business can pay Amazon to host (rent)

If, in the routine operation of my landlord duties--namely, inspection of properties--I come upon IRL versions what the Parler hack later revealed to be digital incarnations of *tens of thousands* of posts between US LEO,  in addition to domestic and foreign-stationed US active duty soldiers engaging with, ""encouraging""* ""planning""* ""conspiring""* etc., action leading up to Jan. 6th and beyond.

Yes, many of these were your run-of-the-mill, harmless type posts you can find hundreds of millions of people --if not, billions--uploading as we speak. But many posts exposed in the Parler hack are far from even the most disturbing political rants. 

They show actionable planning and connection to the events of Jan 6th.  Additionally, these findings alluded to such actions being perpetrated beyond. 

Most worryingly, they demonstrate that those with the want to carry out such measures are embedded more deeply, widely, and predominantly within the military and police--and therefore, theoretically closer to military and police armaments--than anyone (openly) admitted to before.

Are you suggesting that if I, an IRL land lists found such items and materials in a physical IRL unit, in the abundance which the Parler hack found I am under *no obligation* to call my LEO (local, city, state, and federal) to report my findings?

If you truly believe that, I'd like to know why.

"That is terrible advice.

1- A PO Box destroys any plausible deniability. “Drug dealers” aren’t the ones that are interested in putting you in jail. What do you think they’re gonna do? Show up at your house and ask to share a bowl?

2- Customs won’t fuck you. It is just the only place in the US your package can be searched without a warrant. So you run the gamble of getting a letter saying someone tried to send you and illegal substance and they took it. Domestic is much more reliable but what you said is wrong.

3- they don’t send you a letter telling you that you need to claim anything. 

4- Poisons, cuts, and fake reviews? What? Try real reviews in a real marketplace that competes for cost and quality. Anyone with half a brain always tests what they get. Regardless you are far more likely to get a quality product for a fraction of the price online. The guy down the street is much more likely to sell you heavily cut, shitty product because you have limited options you don’t get to see what the guy before you thought of his product.

Its just like Amazon. If it’s a sketchy product with one review... your taking a risk not knowing what you are gonna get. If you are ordering something with 1200 5 star reviews, it’s probably pretty decent stuff. Vendors pay a substantial fee (some around $1000) to establish a vendor account.

This is an obvious truth.

Not every business is a corner store because we already live in the monopolistic future that liberal economists knew was disastrous for a capitalist system. If in fact there were way more mom and pop conveniences and immigrant owned dry cleaners, and way fewer Walmarts and apples, then the profit rate wouldn't be so astronomically high that small business can't even dream to compete.

"The problem is that if Amazon threw out 25% of its profit to stop treating its employees like shit, then at the next meeting the shareholders would be throwing out the executives. Shareholders in practice are always going to prioritize profits above all else. What needs to happen is legal penalties and fines for employee exploitation that then make it less profitable to do that. 

It’s the same problem as when fines for breaking environmental regulations are less than what the company saves by ignoring them in first place.

The easiest solution is just to make fines for shitty behavior significant enough that it’s not worth being evil. Then executives would be pressured not to fuck employees and the environment by shareholders instead of the opposite that it is right now.",1611002859.0,1
"the more obvious outcome specifically to avoid the start up cost (which would most likely be justified anyway, because we're talking about a very simple and obvious investment which will undoubtedly shake up who the worlds richest people are), would be that amazon stocks tank when they start posting gimped profits, and then they get bought up because people understand that once they have decision making power they can just say ""stop treating employees like people and go back to what you were doing last week"" and see massive profit gains come back overnight.

when youre looking at smaller deviations from average profit rates then things are less obvious, specifically because the system oscillates around the average profit rate rather than being sucked into it like a black hole. in normal competitive circumstances, for instance, the amount of capital fleeing from an industry posting 1% lower rates is based on speculation that another use of your capital is going to be +1% over average instead of -1.3%. In a sense its a higher entropy situation where there are many possible states of capital allocation where everybody is, +- a few percent, okay. as opposed to a very low entropy state like where amazon has suddenly and unnecessarily tanked its profit rates and created a very obvious stream of unrealized profitability.

there are also anti-competitive practices, like selling product at a loss in a war of attrition where you know you can afford to keep running longer than competition and pick up all the market share. things like this. Things like the growth of walmart however dont happen just on clever tactics like that, the tactics are backed up by actual profitability and cost-cutting especially related to scale and influence over suppliers.

"Do you think current ceos go bankrupt when their companies fail? CEOs who often own more of a company than an individual co-op employee would? 

Employee owned businesses is often a code word for more straightforward socialist policy or a far more mixed economy like the Scandinavians, but assuming the other commenter meant co-ops in our current market economy, they do share risk. 

In most co-op scenarios the employees buy into the company via a share system like our stock market, but evenly distributed among paying employees. 

These companies aren’t publicly traded or beholden to “shareholders” in the traditional sense so they can operate more conservatively than others so I’d assume they wouldn’t be beholden to massive corporate debt, but if not, they still wouldn’t go bankrupt.  

Like any corporation, debt is collected/expunged via bankruptcy or liquidating assets. (There’s also the hedge fund world but we will ignore that) The CEO’s house isn’t seized in the bankruptcy because your corporation bears the debt. 

The only risk employees expose themselves to is losing the money they initially invested to join the co op.

Also, weird that you mention 99% of companies fail but ignore the vast majority of employees work for corporations that don’t fail.

"Well said and more nuanced than most.  Have an upvote.  

&gt; Just because a crime involves speaking doesn't mean it's inherently legal due to the freedom of speech.  

In general, I'd agree with that.  For example, if I get 4 guys together and I instruct them how they are going to rob a bank' that's illegal even if I never touch the stolen money or participate in the robbery (I'm guilty of conspiracy, and there is no questioning that).  
Same thing with false advertising- if I say my donuts are sugar free, and they're not, I've misrepresented the product and my speech is not protected.  

But the juicy one- I'm not allowed to incite violence.  If I am addressing a crowd and I said 'everyone go kill a police officer!' there I am absolutely inciting violence and I am guilty whether someone attacks a cop or not.  
But there is a huge gray area there.  If I address a crowd and I say 'we need to take back our city!', I could be saying people should join neighborhood watch and report illegal activity, or I could be saying we should form citizen patrols to keep drug dealers out, or I could be saying we should take up arms and overthrow the government.  Which is it?  

I believe if there's ANY question, one MUST err on the side of free speech.  And even that is a slippery slope to avoid if possible.

&gt; Have you ever considered that the people who rattle off a list of constitutional rights and say ""the constitution"" a lot don't actually seem very fond of constitutional rights? For example, you seem to think people should be required to grant a platform--not very keen on their freedom of speech, huh?  

I very much consider this.  Apple and Google have a right to speak just as much as Trump or Parler.  And that speech can include NOT repeating the words (or computer code) of others.  But that decision not to speak MUST NOT stop or prevent the speech of others.  

Specifics- Amazon and Google both terminated Parler's accounts.  I think that's kinda crappy, but it is their right to do so, if Google doesn't want to host Parler's app then that is their right.  I believe Google should not be *forced* to expend resources hosting content they want not to.  Users can sideload Parler's app or Parler can post it to F-Droid or another alternative app store.  

Apple is a different story.  Apple, by design, builds iPhones to refuse to run programs that don't come from their App Store.  And that is a conundrum- I believe Apple has the right to choose not to host the app, but I DON'T believe Apple does or should have the right to tell users they aren't *allowed* to download the app on phones they own.  So Apple is trying to have their cake and eat it too- on one hand they want a monopoly on iOS app distribution, on the other hand they are not willing to act as a 'common carrier', so they are dictating to people what apps they are allowed to run on their phone.  THAT is not okay.  

More broadly, there's a question we all should ask- if the public square is privately owned, how should 1st Amendment protections apply?  
I don't have the answer there, but I do think that when the public square is privately owned, the private owner does have at least some responsibility to uphold the Constitution.  
How to implement/enforce that without creating a much bigger problem, I don't know.  Always open for ideas :)",1611041717.0,-1

However, when Parler started to get ""big"" I made an account just to see what the hell the fuss was all about, I followed some of the bigger names and saw zero calls for violence. Granted I followed, you could say, the more sane people, my account was deleted less than 24 hours later.

I've googled it earlier, and honestly the opinion seems very split. I don't think you can say anything definitely on that matter, unless you cherry-pick your sources.

Besides, that's not my argument... I said that **BOTH** platforms were used for malicious activity, but Parlor is *designed* for malicious activity.

&gt;  these companies Google/Apple/Amazon, are selectively applying their rules

I agree. But I think the argument is being bent too much into a ""left-wing vs right-wing"" argument by the (right-wing) US media, with US-centric worldview, into a political debacle.

The platforms are only doing the *bare minimum* that they can get away with, when it comes to specific *forms* of activity - such as racism or violence. They've failed for years to prevent a spread of general misinformation, or sufficiently crack down on fake accounts manipulating their algorithms.

&gt; These 3 companies have too much power over the internet and they're acting too much like publishers filtering content and services.

I'd at least add facebook and twitter to that list.

I think there needs to be a more formal, legal set of requirements for what *should* be filtered, but at the same time I think private platforms have every right to filter *anything else* that they feel like. It's your choice to use their platform, under their terms of service, so if you think they're over-filtering then you can go elsewhere.

And ironically, I'd say that much of the right-wing US media outlefts (e.g. Fox News), who have for years been a laughing stock of the world for fake news and misinformation, are equally guilty of failing to censor dangerously inaccurate claims from being published.",1611058953.0,-1

For years these right wing people were told ""just build your own app"" they do it, it's taken down everywhere. But that's not the scariest thing in my opinion. Apple and Google can turn down whatever apps they want, they're a private company, the scary thing in my opinion is Amazon AWS turning off their hosting. 

This kind of sets a precedence that these new start ups have to do business the way Amazon tells them, as they host most of the internet. So how's a small startup supposed to build a huge server farm?

Parlers rules ""followed"" the law, meaning illegal content was supposed to be moderated, so incitement of violence ect. However, they weren't doing it enough, but I'm partial to the idea that it's just a matter of scale. They're a startup, how can they moderate that many users so fast? 24 hours notice isn't a lot of time to get their shit together. 

I'm very open to alternatives to Facebook and Twitter, but if these companies aren't given enough time to do, they're power only grows.

"Excerpts from the article:-

""Brave, which currently boasts 24 million monthly active users, has been an early supporter of IPFS, working on the standard since 2018. But with version 1.19 of the Brave browser releasing today, Brave users will be able to access IPFS content directly by resolving URIs that start with ipfs://. They can also opt to install a “full IPFS node in one click,” making their browser a node in the peer-to-peer network. 

“IPFS gives users a solution to the problem of centralized servers creating a central point of failure for content access,” Brave’s CTO Brian Bondy said in a statement, adding that this gives Brave users “the power to seamlessly serve content to millions of new users across the globe via a new and secure protocol.”

IPFS project lead Molly Mackinlay adds that IPFS’ enablement of the decentralized web can overcome “systemic data censorship” from governments and Big Tech. “Today, Web users across the world are unable to access restricted content, including, for example, parts of Wikipedia in Thailand, over 100,000 blocked websites in Turkey, and critical access to COVID-19 information in China,” says Mackinlay, “Now anyone with an internet connection can access this critical information through IPFS on the Brave browser.”

This effort to make web content more resilient and unconstrained comes at a time when service and platform owners are facing tough choices about what content should remain online. Following the Capitol riots, President Trump was silenced on both Facebook and Twitter, followed by the Parler app being pulled from both the Google and Apple app stores, and Amazon withdrawing its centralized web services. A decentralized web enabled, in part, by IPFS would make that kind of control more difficult in the future. """,1611077096.0,1

"Do other rights *specifically* state that they only pertain to the government? We're talking strictly about freedom of speech afforded by the First Amendment.

Correct.  It's my property, you are a guest, and I can order you off my land at any time.  
The same principle DOES apply to a hosting company.  If I'm a hosting company, what I put on my server (and what I refuse to put on my server) is both my choice as a business and also to some degree a form of speech.  If I don't want to host Parler, I should not be *legally required* to do so.  

That doesn't make it right or good for me to kick off things I don't like.  I believe if I'm a hosting company, I *should* not be editorializing with which customers I serve.  But what is good/right/moral and what is legally required are rarely the same thing.  

With that all in mind- I think what Google and Amazon did is crappy, but it's only Apple I have a problem with.  Apple intentionally designs its phones so they refuse to run software that doesn't come from the App Store.  So Apple's decision to not publish the app isn't just affecting Apple's servers, *it's telling millions of conservative iPhone users that they are **not allowed to install an app that they want on their own phones***.  And THAT we should all have a problem with.  

On an Android phone, you can download an app as a .APK file and install it yourself.  That way if I want an app Google wants nothing to do with, I can do it myself.  iPhone has no such capability.

"&gt;The government makes 3 and a half trillion dollars

About as much of that as I see of Apple's profits, but the vast majority of Apple's profits go to the uber-wealthy shareholders, whereas the money given to the government doesn't generally go to the uber-wealthy (or at least not in multi-billion dollar chunks, like for the CEOs of Amazon, Walmart, etc.).

What I DO see is a lot of government jobs available with decent pay and benefits for those who are qualified, roads that run from my house to anyone else's house in the entire country, a cheap, easy postal service that delivers to anyone in the US, safety in buying groceries, generally safe tap water, regulated automobiles that I know will have a basic level of safety and are regularly tested, a guaranteed financial payout based on my years of working experience and compensation, and a whole host of other services that work just fine.

I'm not saying that every government-run service is amazing, I'm saying that the government doesn't have the motive of earning a profit for shareholders at the expense of the consumers or the country in general, and for services that should be available to everyone and have a ridiculously high barrier to entry in the competitive market, getting rid of that profit motivation for the group providing that service can be really, really good for consumers. 

&gt; Which market is amazon a monopoly in? Do you know what a monopoly is? 

Everyone knows that they're not technically a monopoly, but they engage in monopolistic business practices and have enough market share at this point that they know that customers will continue spending money on Amazon goods/services to make up for a few returns here and there, and at the end of the day they earn a massive profit.

&gt; At the end of the day these, and your postmates story, are just anecdotes. There is a reason it's a common sentiment that government services are inefficiently run. 

Sure, because 25 years ago the DMV was a slow piece of garbage because it wasn't funded well enough to run smoothly, and making fun of government inefficiency has been a pastime for a lot of Americans for years and years because of confirmation bias where people notice the things that confirm their bias and tend to ignore the things that don't confirm their bias.

But there's a reason that the government runs certain services, and that's because it makes more sense to have the government run a service when it costs absurd amounts of money to compete in a space, there's little or no competition, the service is a necessity for the vast majority of people, and building out enough infrastructure would allow for unlimited use without adding real cost.

And most of Amazon's money literally goes back into Amazon in order to make it better. 

&gt;What I DO see is a lot of government jobs available with decent pay and benefits for those who are qualified

How easy is it to get a government job when you're unqualified, and have cushy benefits, and keep it a long time, compared to a private sector job though?

&gt;roads that run from my house to anyone else's house in the entire country, a cheap, easy postal service that delivers to anyone in the US, safety in buying groceries, generally safe tap water, regulated automobiles that I know will have a basic level of safety and are regularly tested, a guaranteed financial payout based on my years of working experience and compensation, and a whole host of other services that work just fine.

And I see roads in disrepair for years, cheap and efficient postal alternatives, overly strict or incompetent classifications, a government-led water crisis, vehicle recalls and private innovation driving safety features, a slush fund for governmental expenditures, and plenty of other services that are either passable or beyond useless.

&gt;I'm not saying that every government-run service is amazing, I'm saying that the government doesn't have the motive of earning a profit for shareholders at the expense of the consumers or the country in general, and for services that should be available to everyone and have a ridiculously high barrier to entry in the competitive market, getting rid of that profit motivation for the group providing that service can be really, really good for consumers. 

But it should have a motive of benefiting society, and it often doesn't do that. Even when it tries, it's often inefficient and wasteful. And sometimes that profit motivation can also be really, really good for consumers. Thanks to Amazon (who also sometimes does their own shipping), the USPS and other delivery companies have expanded their Sunday deliveries.

How can a company that isn't a monopoly engage in monopolistic business practices with any effectiveness? There are plenty of alternatives to Amazon in a wide variety of categories. You could buy/sell at Walmart, host on Azure, use a different digital assistant, buy other tablets/streaming devices, use other streaming services, deliver with UPS, etc. There are numerous alternatives. Amazon is big, and makes a lot of money, but it is not close to being a monopoly, nor does it engage in monopolistic practices.

&gt;Sure, because 25 years ago the DMV was a slow piece of garbage because it wasn't funded well enough to run smoothly, and making fun of government inefficiency has been a pastime for a lot of Americans for years and years because of confirmation bias where people notice the things that confirm their bias and tend to ignore the things that don't confirm their bias.

So, Facebook and Amazon agree with share user data with each other. This is a highly valuable agreement and also saves both time and money.

This essentially makes it so that one benefits when the other remains successful. If facebook were to collapse and lose marketshare with a competitor, their ability to gather information on users becomes limited as fewer people use the platform and instead use a competitor.

The big tech companies essentially make politicians their servants. Not allowed to talk about any of the terrible shit they're up to. And essentially destroying the government's ability to properly govern those companies.

Thus, again, cementing each company's reliance on the other. If Amazon backs off from their share of controlling our government, it'll make it much harder for facebook to retain that control. And vice versa.

The companies need each other and rely on each other to succeed.

The production of pedophilia content actively harms an innocent child who has no way of protecting themself.  The production of seditious content does not harm innocent people.  

&gt; Also, how is private organizations refusing to do business with unsavory individuals even remotely close to preventing freedom of speech?  

Taken by itself, as a concept, it's not.  And both people and private organizations have a strong and legitimate interest in being able to decide who they do and do not do business with and what sort of content they host on servers they operate.  
However when the public square, where national discourse takes place, is privately owned, 1st Amendment rights can't simply be waived off with 'it's not the government doing the censoring'.  
Right now we have a situation where if you piss off 6 liberal guys from California (Jeff Bezos/Amazon, Sundar Pichai/Google, Satya Nadella/Microsoft, Tim Cook/Apple, Mark Zuckerberg/Facebook, Jack Dorsey/Twitter) and they legitimately (within their rights) decide to stop doing business with you, you are effectively off the Internet.

"Legitimate usage means some of the uses that people complain about are very legal even without getting creative.

For instance, purchase history. This data is required to service refunds and such. It can also be used to recommend products, but GDPR is only concerned with it a company can store the data and not what can be done with the data if they can legitimately need it for business.  Now GDPR prevents sharing that data, with personally identifiable information however it can be anonymized and your good.

The future will be slightly different.

People will do stuff and interact with a site like Amazon and they will keep your purchase history like they do for everyone legitimately. They would also anonymize the data but create key categories so they know the ""type"" of consumer you are and the types and brands you purchase. This won't be an great as keeping browsing history, but it's still effective for the biggest consumers.

All the data is perfectly anonymized, but still lets them have the analytics they want even if it's not as good.

Social media and advertising would have a harder time, but people are willing to give some data.  You don't need to sell the data to the advertiser and instead you let advertisers target demographics you support.  Advertisers never see the data and only know you served based on a demographic. Advertisers are ok with this because they want conversions and only care they reach someone willing to buy their product.

The biggest key point is that nobody needs to release their data to advertisers. They don't need to know your sitting in some cafe when they serve you an ad about coffee.  Only the site/service/app that your using needs to know and the advertiser only needs to know someone is on a cafe.

"I agree that there is a problem.I do not agree that forcing non-governmental agencies to associate with speech they don't like is the solution to the problem.

People are not getting banned for their viewpoints -- this is clear in the fact that there are vast numbers of conservative viewpoints being discussed on Twitter, youtube, etc. and no one is banning them.

Trump, Milo, Carl Benejamin, etc, are banned for their *behavior*.   Intentionally inciting fear and hatred, using incendiary and vitriolic language disguised as ""free speech"".

Tump/et. al are not demanding the right to speak -- they have that, and Twitter can't silence them.  Google can't silence them.

They are demanding the right to an audience.  That has never been a protected right in this country.  The basic vision of the first amendment is that you can go down to the local city park and pontificate.  You can still do that.  Twitter can't stop you.

Parler also got booted for its behavior -- by refusing, openly, to develop content moderation policies that would help to keep illegal and violent speech off their platform.

That stuff also exists on Twitter/et.al, but twitter expends considerable effort and expense to detect it and remove it proactively, and to ban people who refuse to follow the rules.   Parler left it up to a user jury -- not objective policies, but a group of users who would read a reported post or tweet and decide whether or not it should be removed.  These are users who think nothing should ever be removed and that speech should have zero limits.  That's why Parler was unable to meet Amazon's requirements.

Even now, Parler and it's defenders say ""They removed all the content Amazon told them to remove!"" as if that cures the breach -- it does not.  They should be finding it on their own.  It should not be Amazon's job (or expense) to police Parler's content for them.

The funniest part about this is that Parler has been working on a system that would comply (allegedly) with Amazon's rules -- that would implement the kind of auotmated censorship they promised their users they would never do -- because the promises they made turn out to be untenable as a business plan.

You should probably ask Amazon, Apple and Google this. I don't work there. If Facebook abandoned all moderation I hope they would get the boot as well. We have already seen places like Voat go offline as well. 

&gt; And you want Facebook to improve their moderation... on what basis? Who  is deciding what is and isn't acceptable? Not that they shouldn't have  moderation, but how would that have stopped these events? 

The company and their users decide what is acceptable by content guidelines and what users report and are willing to deal with. I'm willing to bet that Trump would have been banned long before the 6th if Twitter actually moderated what world leaders say on their platform and held them accountable since they had to explicitly start tagging his tweets saying they were lies. Same with the Iranian leader making anti-semetic comments on Twitter that should have been banned long ago. 

&gt; I don't think it makes it difficult at all. It just shifts people to  another community and likely will be more and more in the shadows rather  than having it more openly discussed. 

But the important part is that the community in the shadows will be harder to access. People are kind of stupid and if something is too difficult when it could be easier they won't go through with it. If for example, Facebook, wasn't as easy to use you wouldn't see people join it as much which leads to a smaller audience and while parts of that audience still wants to overthrow the government they are much smaller and don't have the ability to spread as much and gain traction. There will always be people that believe in terrible things but that doesn't mean we should give them the best tools possible to spread their ideologies around. 

&gt; That isn't true. Sound thought and speech can happen and you can still  have nut jobs doing nut job things. This wasn't even a fraction of the  populous... It was a lot of media hungry divas looking for attention.  Why people want to give these people so much credence is beyond me.

Twitter and Facebook's moderation process is (or at least can be) faster than Parler's, because Parler's moderation chooses a random jury of users to verify that a reported post is rule-breaking.  They do that to avoid a single person (like a Reddit mod or an admin) from being able to yoink something because of their personal preferences.  You assume that the posts on Parler that are being used for justifying shutting them down were reported or even widely viewed.  That's not a good assumption, especially since the reason much of the crap that was done on Facebook and Twitter only remained on their sites because no one had reported it.

Robert Oppenheimer, scientific director of the Manhattan Project that built the first atomic bomb, then working as a consultant to the Atomic Energy Commission, was stripped of his security clearance after a four-week hearing. Oppenheimer had received a top-secret clearance in 1947, but was denied clearance in the harsher climate of 1954.

Look into it some more. I know its hard because at the moment you likely share politics w/ the ultra rich, amazon, facebook, twitter, the government institutions, most schools, the TV, hollywood, China, etc, but go a bit beyond the international conglomerate alliance and you'll find out more and maybe start to wonder if following the mainstream corporate politics is in your self-interest.

The point I make here is: **fingerpointing.** I believe they just needed a scapegoat for bad management. Truth is, just like at home, datacenter or mining companies for that matter, they pay for the energy they use and thus the providers know how much they have to provide, this was not a spike of usage, it was just the way it was for a long period of time and all of the sudden they had an issue with it.

"CNN put out an article [How Trumpism explains the GameStop stock surge](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/27/politics/gamestop-stock-surge-trumpism/index.html). It is the most low effort, inaccurate, and clearly one-sided thing I've read all day.

&gt;... the amateurs began a coordinated effort of buying GameStop stock to drive its price higher and higher. (It's worth noting that Reddit was also a gathering spot for some of the most ardent Trump supporters in 2016.)

How dare people buy stocks we don't want them too! And is that really worth noting?

&gt;That effort to screw the pros... got an unexpected boost from none other than iconoclast-in-chief and Tesla founder Elon Musk, who tweeted ""Gamestonk!"" with a link to the ""wallstreetbets"" subreddit on Tuesday.

&gt;(Musk has also been a longtime critic of social media censoring and was a prominent Covid-19 skeptic. Sound like anyone else we know?)

Is that parenthetical relevant to this at all?

&gt;What's the end game for the GameStop surgers?... Because they don't really believe that GameStop is suddenly the new Amazon or Apple or Google. It's still mostly a business that derives its value from brick and mortar stores in malls. Which, again, is not exactly a big growth area in the coming years.

&gt;The point is that there is no real point beyond showing up the pros -- proving to them that they aren't as smart as they think they are and that they don't have the ability to control everything.

I bought my shares months ago when there was talk about a potential future for the business, before the Chewy guy came into the picture.

"Does anyone really think Gamespot is long for this world (unless they open some new line of business like Netflix did with streaming)? The stock was low (even pre-pandemic) because nobody buys games in stores anymore. When people do buy physical discs, it's often from Amazon or the like. I haven't bought a game from a store in probably 10+ years. They have been unprofitable for the past two years, with no real prospects for turning it around in sight.

What about the people employed there (and the physical stores, etc)? If the business really is doomed, then those stores are occupying space which would be better occupied by some other store which more people would actually go to. Rather than borrowing money to let their current employees stand around not selling games for most of the day, that money could be spent paying someone to sell specialty coffee beans or whatever. The space, labor, and money currently being spent on Gamestop could be better spent (assuming the company isn't viable long-term) on some other business. If a Gamestop location closes, it isn't as if that space disappears; it becomes vacant for some other business to make use of.

A bet against Gamestop (or any company in general) is a way of saying ""the money, labor, land, etc being spent on this company could be better spent somewhere else.""",1611816762.0,1
"Keep in mind that the digital version of the PS5 was grossly underproduced compared to the disc version, so your “less than 1%” of pre-orders isn’t necessarily because there was more demand for the disc version, it’s also to do with the fact that disc was available and digital wasn’t.  Of the four people (and myself) who I know were able to get a PS5, four of us would’ve opted for digital as our first choice but couldn’t find it and opted for the disc version.

Furthermore, “digital” isn’t the only obstacle that Gamestop is fighting against, it’s also other retailers, and especially so during the current stay-at-home situation.  You have large companies like Amazon, Target, Best Buy, Wal-Mart, all offering day of release delivery, and usually some other incentive, such as $10 off or a $10 GC, when you purchase new games.  Add on to this that many people don’t particularly like GameStop or their policies and would almost always prefer to purchase from one of the other stores.

GameStop was sinking, and the next generation probably wasn’t going to change that.  Then COVID came along and ramped up the speed in which they were sinking.",1611824147.0,1
"As far as I'm aware, Melvin had shorts in GME before Cohen took over. It's one of the news pieces that fucked them.

As far as ""Why GameStop then?"" goes with regard to management, I don't know. People see Cohen and the two guys he brought with them as savants I guess.

At this point, the shorts will have to buy shares at the market price in order to get out and give the money back to those they borrowed from. When there are no more shares to buy, however, that's what causes a short squeeze. It's possible that some people will be left holding the bag on GME but tbh I think it's a good long-term play too, with Cohen's plans to turn GameStop into ""the Amazon of gaming"". So if it spikes with a squeeze I might sell off some shares, but I'll likely keep some too.

"&gt; Still, the fundamental issue remains - its propping up an old model in a market that has decidedly moved on to digital.

I'm not finding any U.S. stats that aren't money gated, but [here we can see that retail sales of video games](https://www.statista.com/statistics/281895/video-game-software-retail-sales-in-the-united-kingdom-uk/) in the U.K. have grown steadily, with the only downturn being 2019.  And that is in a relatively smaller and more concentrated country with steadier internet service than you can find in the States.  Retail may not be growing at the same rate as digital, but with spotty internet service across the U.S., monthly bandwidth limits, and digital being the same price point, it points to a trend that physical sales will continue to grow moderately.

Gamestop's problem previously was their reputation and overgrowth.  With physical sales still on an upward trajectory with the industries continued market growth -- even if not showing the same growth models as online sales -- I think Gamestop could have time to pivot to new strategies while still serving the physical market, which isn't just going to disappear overnight.  Their real competitor, I imagine, is Amazon.",1611843802.0,1

GME was cheap because it's a bricks and mortar company competing against Amazon and because there is little certainty that it'll ever manage to turn itself around.

"Dude, your response - that you're assuming i'm on the side of the racist, seditionist, confederates - b/c i am saying there needs to be rules and process around deplatforming is the reason the discourse on this is so broken.

Any set of rules around deplatforming is going to allow providers to deplatform people actively organizing violence and crime, which is what Parler was doing at the end.   On the other hand, service providers shouldn't be allowed to boot people for arguing for the political necessity of a revolution - e.g. when a marxist says we need to overthrow the current gov't and replace it with a socialist or communist structure, or some tea party guy says we need to return to the articles of confederation, that isn't treason, it isn't a crime, and shouldn't get you deplatformed.

Criminal liability for speech is limited to when you're actively organizing an insurrection or imminent violence, or credible threats of violence.  The deplatforming rules to enforce the same standards on core internet platforms like AWS and domain registrars should map to those contours.

The point isn't to protect Parler, the problem is that these tech companies shouldn't be able to unilaterally decide what gets you deplatformed.  What i'm worried about is what Robinhood and Discord are doing to WSB right now for standing up to hedge funds, or what Amazon/Google could easily do in the future, which is deplatform unions (NLRB rules would prevent them from retaliating against union organizers in their workplace, but any union/workers' rights org not directly involved at their workplaces is fair game).",1611879893.0,-1

So often I'll end up with an amazing product with 3 stars stars very few reviews on Amazon.

"idk man. I got offered a free portable charger because my wireless charger stopped working and I jumped on that lol. I left the review but amazon wouldn't let me. The fucked up part is I'm actually satisfied with the new item. Ended up getting 2 of them because amazon delivered to my neighbor, I complained and got a 2nd one sent to me. Neighbor returned it the next day. I hate amazon for multiple reasons and them not letting me leave my legit review pissed me off so I kept the item knowing that amazon has to foot the bill for fucking up on the delivery.

I'll buy something with thousands of reviews or less than 200. I go through each review. I start with the negative reviews first. Then I read the 5 star reviews. Then I go to the 3 star reviews and then the 2 and 4 star reviews. Based on what I read from about 50+ of each type of review, depending on how many there are, I compile the information. I carefully read the reviews and make a point list in my noggin. And then I decide on the odds of the bad things affecting me beyond what I'm capable of handling. And then I look at the odds of those bad things actually happening based on pictures and such.

Then I either purchase it, look for something similar or put it on hold while I make a decision on whether to get that item or something else. I've only had an issue with maybe 3 or 4 items out of hundreds bought. I used a similar process when I was weight the option of buying an extended warranty with one of my old monitors. I calculated how much time I would use the monitor for within the frame of the warranty and decided that while there is always a chance that it will outlast the warranty, in that particular situation I had pretty good odds of using the warranty. It was the first and only extended warranty I ever bought and guess what? The monitor ended up having a severe green tint issue about a week before the warranty ran out. That was $20 well spent. That monitor cost me $500 and I'll bet $10000 I was the only person that went in there with an extended warranty replacement that week.

A few years later I asked my ex roommate to store some stuff for me temporarily. I lost his number and got in contact with him about 6 months later. He started ducking me and I ended up losing that monitor but I figured what the hell. By that point I had gotten way more than $500 of use out of that thing and I was probably going to donate it anyways. Still mad that he kept my other stuff though. Funny thing is that I run into him about once every 3 years. Anyways, I'm way off topic now. Point is that it doesn't matter how many reviews an item has. Just try to make a good decision based on the information you have available. The socks I bought (hot feet) had over 1k reviews. I'd say they were worth every penny. Kept my feet warm this winter. My sleeping bag I took a bit of a gamble with though. I'm noticing that it loses about 1-2 feathers (down) every night I sleep in it. I may contact the company soon to see if they will do anything if the problem persists.

Anyways, hopefully whatever you decide to do works out for you. Paid reviews aren't always incorrect reviews just like good reviews aren't always true reviews. I'll gladly give a 5 star review on a free item I actually like. I'll probably leave 4 if I didn't feel extatic with it but got it for free. I'd probably return it if I thought it was utterly useless.",1612007751.0,-1

"&gt;What we need is a global coherent tax strategy that makes taxes predictable and **fair**
&gt;

I got it. How about, since taxes are supposed to be levies made by the government to discourage certain behavior, we stop taxing people for meeting their material needs through trade? And stop taxing the fruits of people's labor (that they already don't see the full value of)? 

Isn't the whole fuckin point of money to facilitate exchange between parties to meet needs? Shouldn't we, like, restructure how we view taxes to encourage trade and sustainable business, while discouraging hoarding/pillaging the earth for her natural resources? The two root causes of like... 95% of our problems today? 

If the growth of money *was* driving the meeting of new needs, wouldn't **YOU** be more fulfilled than any humans before us? Why aren't you? 

Imagine if taxes, HUGE FUCKIN TAXES, were put on the companies for drilling oil and cutting trees (and any other pillaging of natural resources). And force them to pass those increased costs downstream until it reaches consumers. Wouldn't two natural consequences of this be:

A. People would no longer be faced with the dilemma of many of cheapest goods being horrible for the environment. Your McDonald's burger and Amazon plastic gadgets would increase in price exponentially **because they're horrible for the environment, compared to alternatives.** 

B. If every externalized cost for companies was internalized, wouldn't it reason that the companies who would remain in business would be those that use resources only when truly needed? [Vs the current status quo where companies store billions of gallons of oil during a valley in human need to artificially inflate prices](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN21Z2A2)

And this wouldn't create a stagnant society. Entrepreneurship would **increase** because access to resources would be based solely on effective use, not previously held ownership of the land/resource.

And I won't even get into how unbelievably simple it would be to get over the ""Without profits, no one would have motivation"" hump by simply *proportionally rewarding people for their laborious contributions to society.* 


Combine the two and you'd have a resurgence in tradesmanship, as people would seek to reuse and recycle before consuming more, and people would actually see the fruit of their labor, not their CEO.

"&gt;If they'd have been more subtle they still would have lost money, perhaps not as much, but Game's fundamentals are quite good.

They've collapsed better companies, with stronger fundamentals. 
Gamestop WAS at risk, they're a failing brick-and-mortar retail chain in a marketplace that is dominated with digital sales, or on-line shopping. These investment firms just got stuck in a highly bullish market that very few people saw coming. It was the wake of retail investors dumping HUGE new money into the marketplace in general, which sparked more new money. It's why Tesla is worth soooo much more than it's underlying value: we like the stock!

Hedge funds and investment firms got stuck, realized the market was on an upswing and decided to put a calculated weight on this one stock to do them in. That's the only reason they would put themselves in so much risk. They wanted out, wanted to protect their investment, so they tried to accelerate the time-table, ramp up the perceived negative public sentiment and dilute the market place with 40% additional shares. Then someone watching saw a huge anomaly in a position that was clearly intended to close out in a relative short period of time.

&gt;Now, the current stock price is obviously unrealistic but the $15-30 range isn't.

I fully agree, I would say that a reasonable market cap is right around 1/10th of the current valuation. Which is right in your numbers. But that's still a company at risk, especially if one of the biggest market events has them competing with Target, Bestbuy and Amazon, all vying to have the largest number of consoles to sell.

&gt;And anyways if anybody is invested in GME currently hedging a bit with Puts would not be unreasonable.

If you're trying to time the market, it's not even hedging, it's just taking a position. If there's a run-up, there will be a sell-off. If there's a sell-off, the stock price will fall. Will it fall below it's current price? Probably, but that's hard to say for certain.",1612186943.0,1

"How does someone short selling a company make it more difficult to raise capital?

Short selling has literally no effect on the company that the ""normal"" buying and selling of the stock does not have. Short selling does not make it more difficult to raise capital; the company's financials and business outlook make it difficult to raise capital.

Hell, let's pretend that Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk team up to take the world's largest short position against Apple with 100% of their combined net worth right now. Jeff and Elon borrow Apple stock from current stockholders and then sell that stock to other people who want to buy that Apple stock. Does that transaction make it more likely for Apple to go bankrupt? Does that transaction make it more difficult for Apple to raise capital? 

Of course it doesn't; Apple is still Apple. They will sell as many iPhones, MacBook Pros, and apps from the App Store after Jeff and Elon take their short positions as they were going to sell before Jeff and Elon took their short position. Pretend you are a normal person who just dropped their iPhone 7 in the toilet, so you need to buy a new phone. Are you going to not buy a new iPhone because Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk think Apple stock is overvalued?

If it was as simple as ""just short the company and you can magically hasten them going out of business,"" don't you think that competitors of struggling companies would be continually shorting their stock as an easy way to speed up the decline of their competitors while also making money? Why don't companies do that? Because it is ludicrous.

If that is really how it worked, why the hell would **an owner of the company that someone is trying to short** willingly lend someone their shares in that company so they could short the stock? Remember, **the person who lends the stock to the person taking a short position will get the shares of stock back eventually**. If the stock shares are worth $0 when the lender gets them back, the lender loses money. In fact, the lender has lost 100% of their money invested in that stock (minus the interest paid on the loaned shares). No one would ever allow their shares to be borrowed if shorting a stock was a way to ""hasten"" bankruptcy. ""Sure, borrow my shares of this company have money invested in, I was really hoping someone would come along and hasten bankruptcy for them. I was getting really tired of not losing my investment fast enough!"" said no one ever. The person borrowing the shares bets that the shares will be lower at some point in the slightly immediate future. The person lending the shares bets that when the loaned shares are repaid, the share price at that time + the interest received on the loaned shares will be worth more than if they sold the shares at the current price; in other words, they think that at worst, the share price will only slightly decrease and will hopefully increase during that time because that means that not only did their original investment pay off, but they got paid extra money (the interest) for owning something they already wanted to own.

Why did these hedge funds have massive shorts in GameStop? GameStop's shares were worth $4/share; that means the **maximum** amount of money the hedge funds could have made was $4/share. You don't get rich from a maximum upside of $4/share. Hell, you could short Amazon, Apple, or any other company and make more than $4/share on that short since those companies' share price is likely to swing that much in intraday trading. The hedge funds shorted GameStop because they massive long positions in other brick and mortar retailers. If their bet that the retail sector is a good place to invest money right now is wrong, then *hedging* their bet means taking a position that will make money if the sector sees a decline. 

In other words, if they think that Walmart, Target, Costco, Best Buy, etc., are good companies to invest in right now, what is a company in that sector that they could that would be disproportionally affected by a downturn in the retail sector? Perhaps a brick and mortar retailer that sells only discretionary products, is struggling financially and has financially strong competitors (Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Costco, Amazon, etc.), and going to have to deal with newly released products, that are essential to the items that retailer sells, that are also likely to result in a paradigm shift in the way consumers purchase the products that they sell? 

Suppose your boss came to you and said that you were going to play a game. He would give you a brokerage account with $10,000,000 in it, and you were in charge of investing it for the next 3 years. At the end of 3 years, you keep every dollar in the account greater than $10,000,000, but you are fired if the account has less than $10,000,000 in it at the end of 3 years. The only requirements were you had to take three long positions in brick and mortar retailers and one short position in a brick and mortar retailer. Which publically traded brick and mortar retailer would you choose to take the short position in? 

Remember, you need to pay interest on the shares you borrow to short, so picking a terrible company or one with a high share price will result in you paying more interest and eating into your potential for the $10,000,000 to grow. You don't want to pick a company that is doing really well because while the interest you pay will be super cheap, your maximum profit/share is the current share price (minus interest) while your maximum losses are unlimited.

Shorting to short and hoping to get rich is a horrible prospect. When you take a long position, your maximum loss is capped (the amount of money you invest), and your maximum gain is unlimited. When you take a short position, your maximum gain is capped (at the current price/share), and your maximum losses are unlimited. No one shorts stocks/indexes to get massively rich, and it is super hard to take a short position to get massively rich unless you have inside information or do a ton of research to discover a major flaw or non-correctable point of failure in a company/system before anyone else discovers it. If you were able to discover a fundamental and unfixable flaw with all current and future potential Apple products that was so bad that they would face massive lawsuits for past products and would be unable to ever sell another product in the future, you could get massively rich. Betting that a struggling company worth $4/share won't be around if the retail sector takes a downturn is not the epitome of greed; it's a fairly logical bet that could make you $4/share you owe or lose you unlimited money if you are wrong.

Shorting is done to mitigate losses, not make insanely large gains.",1612207457.0,1

It's a complex situation, and deserves a nuanced understanding.   


It is completely reasonable to be impressed with the accomplishments of a person like Bezos or Gates, as well as being critical of their business practices.   


I guess I don't believe that exploitation is *necessary* for progress. And really, the progress I'm personally working toward would exclude exactly that type of exploitation. It would include the powerful standing up for the weak, the rich standing up for the poor, and using that power and wealth to make life better for the most vulnerable among us. Create a platform, a standard of living, below which we just don't let people fall.   


There are so many possible courses that the future of humanity might take, and from our vantage point many of them seem dire and risky. Then again, there are some really wonderful possible futures we might reach from this point. I hope those are the ones humanity chooses to go down, rather than the possible self-caused extinction route, or some other scifi dystopia.   


From personal experience working in a warehouse that operates much like an Amazon one, it feels like a scifi dystopia. Shit wages, working conditions that broke my human spirit and had me crying when I got home from my 12 hour shifts, a culture of such obvious disregard of my human dignity, lack of restroom breaks or access, the very clear class distinction between different levels of workers, etc. all came across to me as strongly dystopian. I wonder if the valuation of the company, or the personal wealth gained by Bezos and other investors, is nearly enough to make up for the harms that company has wreaked on humanity through its exploited workers.   


It is possible for Bezos to make up for it, and give something back to humanity that is far and away more valuable than any of his real or even imagined wrongdoing. I hope he can accomplish it.

The problem is that the NRA makes so much money they government couldn't possibly think about taking them away or not manufacturing them.

Also, what betrayal by our government? They send military to your houses and start slaughtering us? If anything the capitol raid represents the real danger of people turning against people. I just can't figure out how or where this belief we needs guns to defend against the government comes from. You are talking about a mass of people that outmatch a corrupt government. The other problem is people only want to think the government is the issue when it interferes with their personal interests. If the government took out a big strike on your guns then you are up in arms.

My friend summed it up like this: ""people want less government control over private companies until that private company that operates on its own takes on its personal interests.""

A prime example of this is Parler and Amazon. Amazon is not controlled by the government but when Amazon decided to close Parler out then people wanted the government to step in and because a company like Amazon interfered.

This is relevant as an example because it stands as a testimony that people thinking less government control is only good when it benefits what it feels is emotionally right not what might be factually right.",1612366641.0,1

I literally typed my message as I was sitting in a meeting with 40 colleagues from Singapore to the USA discussing innovations in the digital marketplace presented by expert consultants in the field. In 2025 5 of the top 10 global retailers will be Chinese, all of them based on digital markets. They’ve innovated dramatically in the space, including logistics, data, and ecosystem building and have basically shortcut the need for physical retail in the country because they adopted e-commerce early and have grown significantly. China is also a leader in manufacturing of green tech, EV research, and is building world class transport systems. 

I did study abroad in China and while they may have a comparative lack of higher ed by per capita basis, they do have several great research institutions. Just due to their sheer scale and size of economy they are going be able to innovate more than somewhere like Switzerland.

"""the goal is censorship."" It's not though? The goal is prevention of violence through bullshit. There are laws against hate speech. Going to the internet and saying you want to kill someone is just as illegal as saying it in person.

YouTube and Google are not censoring those who believe that fossil fuels are better than wind turbines. They are stopping people who think it's okay to storm the capitol and wreak havoc based on claims that have no foundational evidence.

These people genuinely shot others under the assumption the election was stolen. However, their big man couldn't even walk with them. He would tweet things like, ""big evidence is coming he prepared."" But you don't need a courtroom to show that evidence. The internet is a place where you can post things without a legal or justice team. If there was ""but evidence."" Then just tweet it for the world to see. But there isn't and then you get into the controversial opinion of do you let people wreak havoc and kill others based on a lack of truthful or evidential information and does it become censorship to stop that.

My opinion is no. Telling someone they can't be on the internet because they think their skin color is superior would be censoring someone but telling someone you can't be here because you are threatening to kill innocent people is enacting on violence which is quite literally illegal. Google isn't telling Parler you can't be on the app store because you don't like black people. They are saying you can't be on the app store because you are threatening politicians and those threats happen to align with those who think they are superior because they are white.

These are the same people that want the government to not interfere with private companies like Amazon or Google until those companies interfere with their opinions. Google doesn't owe you or me anything. The government didn't tell Google or Amazon to make that decision. These companies are also ran by people who make their own decisions and moral choices based on what they think they are obliged or should he obliged to do. But the minute they make those decisions then it's censorship. It's call the internet and these companies are tired of the shit.

Strong language exists to evoke a response, a lot like the one you're having

I don't think people actually equate working in an Amazon warehouse to slavery - if they do they lack perspective

However, with some of the stories coming out of there, we can see that there are instances where people aren't treated as workers should - 1 bathroom on a half acre floor and travel to/from counts against your break time, not allowed to have a water bottle nearby and the only water fountain is near that same bathroom, etc.

The closest strongest description we have for ""they are losing the rights we afford workers"" is ""being treated like a slave"". It gives you pause, because surely they don't actually mean that?

And that 'under threat of force' requirement is silly. Yeah, unskilled workers are free to leave the job they have to go and find another one. Except most unskilled workers live [paycheck to paycheck](https://www.fa-mag.com/news/nielsen--even-many-high-earners-live-paycheck-to-paycheck-22704.html), and having to skip a paycheck (or several) while looking for a new job could set them even further behind in trying to scrape their way out of that no-savings trap.

"I agree with you. I guess the whole mob involvement in unions back in the day didn’t help much either.

I also agree that you need changes legislated on a federal level. At risk of blowing my country’s trumpet too much, I’m just gonna use us as an example.
Here in Australia we have a nationalised minimum wage for everyone over 18. I think it’s like 21$ an hour. No matter what job you’re doing, the employer has to be paying you more than that if you’re an adult. Then on top of that we also have ‘awards’ for a lot of industries.
For example, a warehouse worker is covered by the logistics award which states that the minimum wage fir an adult shall not be less than, say, 23$ an hour. (I don’t know the exact numbers). 

On top of all that, full time workers also have mandatory 4 weeks annual leave every year, and 2 weeks of sick leave every year. Plus mandatory double time on public holidays and sundays.
Yes it increases costs for the company but at the end of the day, a company making as much money as Amazon should be able to look after its workers properly. And the government should be regulating these companies to make sure they’re paying people what they’re entitled to.

Again, anyone can feel free to disagree with me here. I’m not saying my point of view is the ‘be all and end all’. But I honestly can’t find anything wrong with a liveable minimum wage and standardised working conditions for everyone.",1612796308.0,1

"Speaking only to the pay negotiation aspect of unions: Unskilled labor generally wants unions to avoid downward pressure in pay from easily available replacements. The whole premise is that one member's labor is not different from another's i.e. labor inputs matter more than labor outputs. If they get a critical mass of employees to sign on, it becomes cheaper for the company to give them higher pay than replace them all.

Amazon already pays well above industry average with the explicit idea that they want better-than-average workers. They quantify everything in the warehouse so they can separate more productive from less productive workers. Because they pay higher, they get more applicants and so the critical mass of employees required for union success is higher than with other warehouses.

Unions end up spending a lot of their resources protecting their least productive members, the sort of people Amazon will let go at the drop of a hat. I don't see a higher than average wage persisting for warehouse employees if it becomes difficult to get rid of these non-performers.",1612797125.0,-1

"If you kept an eye on tech between the mid-90s to the mid-00s, you'd have a completely different opinion on Microsoft than if you just paid attention to Microsoft over the past decade. They were the definition of a tech monopoly ruthlessly killing competition.

To go to your point: Is Microsoft *unfairly* maligned? Ehh, as someone who doesn't hate Microsoft, I'd say it's not unfair. Linux's rise (perhaps birth as well?) in tech is due to being an alternative to Microsoft, so if you're a Linux user and a big Raspberry Pi believer, this news hurts in that you swore to never use MS for as much as you can.

"Oh i see now. You’re not an Amazon worker, and you only know what you read in Reddit articles. That makes a lot more sense now. I don’t have time to address everything that’s wrong with your statement , but I’ll try. 

First, no one at Amazon warehouses is peeing in bottles or wearing diapers, and I’m willing to bet you $ that you can’t come up with one single name of an employee who has. That rumor was started by a guy who wrote a book about Amazon a few years ago, and it’s never been proven. You can always ask the thousands of AAs over in the Amazon subreddits if they pee in bottles, and you’ll find that they don’t. As far as delivery drivers goes, you’ll find that happens at every company. It’s not like most cities are filled with public bathrooms. (I used to be a delivery driver for Postmates, I often had to drive home to pee because I have a vagina)

Like I said in another post, if AAs don’t meet rates then they make them a WS or TR. That’s standard protocol because it costs more to hire and train a new person than it does to move them to another dept and see if they can do that job instead. They do not normally fire people for not meeting rate, it is usually has more to do with the amount of TOT the AA has. I have only seen people being fired “on the spot” for safety violations or hurting other coworkers. Since COVID began last year, it’s almost impossible to get fired right now unless you do those two things I mentioned. 

I should also add that there are a LOT of inaccuracies in this particular article. One good example is the mention of a man named Smalls who the article claims was fired for organizing a protest, when in reality Smalls was fired for coming to work while on paid leave for COVID and exposing his coworkers to the virus (there are dozens of other articles that mention this if you care to check). 

Another example is that the article claims one worker saw anti-union posters in the bathroom, when in reality our bathroom flyers are all the same monthly releases of “In-Stall-ments”, so if one person saw it, then so did everyone else, and there are not one million AAs claiming to have seen it. There’s no way this one AA has his own private bathroom with his own personal In-stall-ments poster. 

I’m glad that you’re willing to stick up for us, but please don’t believe everything you read in articles without doing research. If you want to know what AAs are actually complaining about, just head over to the Amazon subreddits and see for yourself.",1612801124.0,-1

My point still stands though if you consider the total cost of an employee to the company. The health and safety things the workers are pushing for will cost money. Amazon operates with extreme efficiency in their warehouses. Health and safety changes across the board could be very expensive and cut into slim margins. If Amazon cannot afford to put these in place (evidenced by the fact they have been pushing against unionization) they shouldn't operate. If they can fix these issues with robots, good for them, but that shouldn't be a factor in whether or not you provide the protections that your employees are begging for.",1612801740.0,1

"I was speaking more generally, rather than about Google. But joining an ideological union is not very appealing to me. Even if I agree with the ideas now, what happens when I don't? If my opinion ends up in the minority of workers, now my union is working against my interests. You may find it morally reprehensible to work on military projects (I can respect that opinion), but what if I would find that type of work rewarding? Maybe I think my company should work on that stuff so we get a say as opposed to some more typical defense contractor. Point is - a union should be, ya know, united, right? What can we all agree on? Pay, benefits, work life balance. I dunno about much else I can agree with essentially all my coworkers about. 

Again, parental leave at these places is best in the country. I understand that it's even more generous in some other places... but our pay is much higher than those places. So, I don't particularly care. Am I really supposed to agree to go on strike (for example) for parental leave when I'm in the 1%, with better parental leave than nearly everyone in my country? There are more important things that I care about, and different ways I prefer to make an impact. 

&gt; Unionising doesn't have different priorities, but if large companies like Google and Microsoft would have unions in the US, it would show the rest of the country that it's possible.

I don't get why you say it ""doesn't have priorities."" Is it not more important for a large exploited work force to unionize than for a tiny group of extremely privileged rich people to do it? If you had to pick one group, you couldn't decide? Tech workers have relatively little to gain from this. I see a lot of calls for tech workers to unionize, but... retail? Food service? EMS? Nurses? I dunno... they all seem like they'd benefit greatly, so that's why I say comments like yours don't align with priorities. Sell it to the people who need it most rather than trying to make it sound like our country's best-treated workers really need it. It's marketing advice, not moral. 

&gt; Highly paid workers can take less of a risk with unions and pave the way for the wage slaves at Amazon/Walmart.

It's percentage-based dues, right? Post-tax? So the risk feels high to me. You can argue I don't ""need"" the money... then that's kinda my point - if we are just overflowing with money and perks, maybe we are a bad place to ""start.""

To help do that, the Technology Institute is working with academic partners, including the Block Center for Technology and Society at Carnegie Mellon University, to build tech tools to help workers organize. (Shuler wouldn't elaborate on specific tools, noting the lengths companies have gone to surveil and stymie unionization efforts.)

"Historically, this is an inaccurate statement, though those which do fair well, are either outside the US or have small industry representation.

If you want to know why cars in the US are expensive despite being made in the US, that's due to unions.

If you want to know why a banana costs 50 cents or a loaf of bread is $2, that's due to unions.

If you want to know why you're being fee'd to death when boarding an airline, that's due to unions.

&amp;#x200B;

While everyone seems to think unions are good because pay increases, what they fail to consider is the overall cost this has across the board.

For a company like Amazon, unions will cost customers more money. The ""standard of living"" salary is rarely the goal for unions, because the more money you make, the more money they make.

Unions have a financial stake to get you more money and everyone knows companies don't pay this.

Customers do.

On the flip side, unions have lead to improved working conditions, though largely indirectly rather than directly.

Companies pay attention to what's going on, and if Company A gets unionized and ends up suffering because of it, Company B will make changes to prevent unionization.

In an non-coincidental situation, it is always very large companies that are usually pushed into unionization.

This is because most larger companies go public during their growth, which means stockholders call the shots, not companies.

Employees become a line item on balance sheets, one in which every stockholder wants removed from them. Employees ruin profits, but are a necessary evil.

Keeping them happy is not a priority. Getting them at 120% production is, and this is tipping point unions start to gain momentum.

It's a trade-off, like everything else. Of course, everyone should earn a comfortable wage based on the work they do. Company executives, however, don't care about this stuff. They just want to see higher profits and more investors.

Companies like Amazon, Google, and Apple have valuations worth billions, but not a single cent of this valuation is about the employee.

All this gets ruined with unions, and customers pay the bills.

Not happy Amazon workers are going to unionize, but I don't fault them.

I fault the greedy stockholders which are ruining America from the inside out, like a cancer that can never be cured.

"As someone who has worked in warehouse and manufacturing for about a decade, here are some of my thoughts. 

Amazon has a heavy temporary employee presence in all of their warehouses. These jobs pay about $1 less an hour than through the company and amazon isn't responsible for their health insurance or unemployment claims. The benefits these agencies offer are trash and you're probably better off paying everything out of pocket. 

I've worked for warehouses where everyone up to an including leads and Supervisors were through temp agencies and very few people actually through the company. Some ""temporary"" employees being their for 4+ years. They also didn't pay benefits to the employees they did hire because they had so few actual employees that the fine was cheaper than paying benefits (this was around 2012 iirc, no idea if this is still their policy). Even more ironically is they were a third party handler of trader Joe's, a company i always see being touted as a beacon of ethical standards. Anyways, I wouldn't see Amazon as going that far, but they will definitely hire less and expand the roll and presence of temporary employees to offset the expense of union labor.

Amazon is leading the charge in automation, unionizing will only encourage them to do this faster. 

I have lived and worked in an heavy warehousing and manufacturing area my entire life, and there is an Amazon fulfillment center in my area. I never worked there, but it was a great stepping stone for experience for a lot of people I know. Temp agencies will give you a chance with 0 experience. If you work hard and get a little lucky you get hired. You last for a year or two and either move up internally or go directly to a hire paying company. Recruiters will not take temporary experience as seriously as full time experience. This union will hurt young, inexperienced workers the most as they will have a hard time getting in full time, and a harder time not getting laid off.

Anybody who made it this far would probably think I'm vehemently anti union, im not. Collective bargaining is an important tool, but I feel the threat of unionization does more for less than an actual union does in most cases. Furthermore I think a union makes even less sense for low to mid wage jobs and entry level work like Amazon. Anybody who isn't trained on heavy equipment   is extremely replaceable and thats a large chunk of Amazon's warehouse workforce. I see a lot of people celebrating this, but I just see too many ways where this goes horribly wrong for workers.",1612815709.0,1

"Also anti-union here but I don't want to be.  I was in an office worker's union holding an IT helpdesk position.  IT helpdesk doesn't really fit the traditional union model of scheduled breaks and shifts bound by the clock.  I complied, but it was strange.  What I hated is that in this office worker's union, most of the union members were female.  For most of them, their husbands were the breadwinners and what they made was just butter on top.  So naturally when it came time to bargaining for the next contract, they would do things like slash benefits or go with a more expensive plan to get more paid time off in trade.  Because most of them were on their husband's heathcare plan.  My vote didn't matter.  And when it came time to bargain for wages, they put people like me in helpdesk in the spotlight to argue for higher wages.  We were paid equally across the board.  So here is me with a fresh master of science degree working helpdesk for $20/hr, while a call center phone operator made the exact same money as me with no education beyond high school.  It was super frustrating to have to wear all the technology hats plus be the subject matter expert and support for the whole operation while making a low wage considering the nature of the work.  We were only allowed 40 hours per week as OT was strictly forbidden, so we were ran ragged the whole time and always behind while fat ass Karen sat in her chair and answered a phone once in a while.  We also had multiple members of the union who somehow got to claim that they were injured by their office chairs and were unable to work.  They received full pay and benefits, just no working involved.  As long as the doctor kept signing the slip, they just sat at home and collected a pay check.  My team tried to vote ourselves out of the union, but it was quickly negated by all the fat Karens using us as leverage for their laziness.  Finally, the union also tell you how to vote as far as US presidential elections.  Of course they can't force you, but you'd better pretend like you are going to vote for who they suggest.  They also highly suggest that you should donate to charities of their choice.  I hated that fucking job.

Now out of the union and into a different company, I've tripled my wage since then working for an at-will employer.  I've been able to negotiate higher wages, get bonuses, all the stuff you'd expect an upstanding company to do.  

Unfortunately, not all companies are good, and it seems like the larger they are, them more untouchable and corrupt they will be.  I think there are good unions out there, but there has to be a balance.  I also grew up around the Detroit auto industry, the grandfather of unions.  But that was always a constant war as well.  Managers always trying to pull fast ones, while union employees showed up drunk for work with no consequences.

Mutual agreements can work fine.  I'm proof of that.  As soon as contracts are introduced into the mix, both sides piss all over each other without getting the contract wet.   But in the case of Amazon, those employees are getting fucked by the man, so maybe a union would be the right answer for them.",1612830036.0,-1

"So this weekend I stumbled upon this old article from 2018 and it made me realize... terms like ""technology"" and ""labour market"" paired together in a sentence don't **necessarily** imply full-automation, jobs being lost, social/identity crisis, and so forth.

The Amazon Prime Future can't be the only potential path our species has available to walk.

The question here is: **can DAOs become one of the most powerful tools in humanity's process of shaping tomorrow's labour market?** Will blockchain be able to become more than just shitcoins... a solid foundation upon which a fair &amp; equal &amp; distributed job market can arise? 

I've personally found this idea very engaging, to say the least, and not far from realistic.

Even a few years ago, thinking of people collectively working together on a project was deemed impossible without some form of centralized hierarchy. Now, a panoply of internet-born companies emerge every day, without the need of having a physical place and/or even a legal entity! 

We're starting to shift away from the old job market paradigms. Indeed, IMO we're slowly but inevitably watching the birth of a new one.

A distributed job market, where individuals that don't physically know each other, or act behind a pseudonym, work together &amp; are able to trust each other (or at least the technology underlying their organization) to achieve common goals. 

We can break centuries-old hierarchies and rules, thanks to a technology (blockchain) helping people enforce transparent, fair, equal rules for everyone to conform to.

To paraphrase some other primate, ""tradition is just peer pressure from dead people.""

Fuck 'em.

Blockchain tech could be the foundation of a landmark change that shapes tomorrow's labour market. People can work and succeed collaboratively and effectively, attracting a new generation of talent.

IMO, society's ability to grasp or at least use the DAO concept like the guys who wrote the post are building will be a key factor in enabling individuals &amp; organizations to manage their projects effectively and achieve operational excellence.",1612892885.0,1
"“ Facial recognition software developed by China-based Dahua, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of video surveillance technology, purports to detect the race of individuals caught on camera and offers to alert police clients when it identifies members of the Turkic ethnic group Uighurs.

Dahua, though among Chinese companies sanctioned by the U.S. government, has a growing presence in the country with sales and support offices in Irvine and Houston. Despite restrictions on its business within the country, the company struck a deal, reportedly valued at $10 million, with Amazon for 1,500 thermal cameras and there are 80 public contracts to purchase the company’s equipment in California alone.

Screenshots of Dahua platforms, provided to The Times by video surveillance research organization IPVM, raise troubling privacy concerns. A user guide for a service targeted at law enforcement clients indicates the company’s technology can send a warning when it detects someone it identifies as Uighur; a consumer-facing product offers a feature to sort by race individuals who pass in front of its cameras.

The previously unreported features come to light weeks after the U.S. government officially declared that China’s campaign against the largely Muslim ethnic Uighur minority is genocide. New details about the oppression of Uighurs in Xinjiang have emerged after former detainees spoke to BBC and alleged that women in the “reeducation” camps were systemically raped. The Associated Press reported Uighur women had been systemically sterilized to curb the population. Some have been sent to forced labor camps that are reportedly tied to dozens of U.S. brands. Others have disappeared without a trace, leaving their families to quietly wonder where they have gone.

Dahua was added to the U.S. entity list in 2019, along with 27 other companies including the tech giant Huawei, for its ties to the “human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression,” according to the Department of Commerce. Being on the list doesn’t restrict U.S. companies or agencies from buying Dahua products — it urges caution when doing so — but blocks those companies from buying American products.

New details shared with The Times show Dahua developed capabilities that could further China’s campaign against Uighur Muslims. Screenshots provided by IPVM show product support documents for Dahua’s police surveillance platform that include several references to “real-time warning for Uighurs.”
Screenshots show that the real-time warning feature requires specific equipment that “support reporting Uighur attributes.”
The documents also reference “real-time warning for non-local Uighurs.”

Along with tracking members of the ethnic group, the service touts its broad facial recognition capabilities. The documents say this service can categorize every face detected for “similar or same passerby photos.”
A guide for a different Dahua policing tool lists categories of people the company can track, including “Uighurs with hidden terrorist inclinations,” a screenshot shows.

The consumer-facing race filter alarmed Daniel Lewkovitz, chief executive of Calamity Monitoring, an Australian security company. Lewkovitz said he found the function when using the platform, called SmartPSS, on his desktop computer to look through footage to help the police in a criminal matter. His company will stop working with Dahua due to human rights concerns, he said.

“As soon as I became aware of it, I was absolutely appalled by it and I issued an instruction to my senior management that we are going to be moving away from this vendor,” Lewkovitz said.
Although being on the entity list doesn’t prohibit U.S. companies from purchasing Dahua equipment, the National Defense Authorization Act has since August prohibited the use of federal funds to enter into, extend or renew any contracts to purchase Dahua equipment. But at least one California contract to purchase Dahua equipment — the biggest in the state, according to public procurement data — used federal funding.
According to purchase documents reviewed by The Times, Modesto City Schools paid $362,000 to buy and install 57 Dahua camera kits in buses in October. School district spokeswoman Becky Fortuna said the cameras were purchased using federal funds and were intended to enhance the district’s contact-tracing efforts on school buses.

Fortuna said the district was not aware Dahua was on the entity list or that there were bans on using federal funding to purchase Dahua equipment. The district is seeking advice on how to proceed with the existing camera systems it has installed, she said, but won’t be buying anymore Dahua equipment.
Considering the U.S. government has already censured numerous Chinese companies on human rights grounds, anyone doing business with companies such as Dahua — even if those deals are legally compliant — should take into account the genocide against the Uighurs, Arkin said.
“China is buying those technology and those hardware to monitor us and destroy our lives,” Arkin said.”

"I think that’s a very naive assessment of things in that there’s a gradual creep to all of this. 10 years ago vs today is a vastly different internet. Call me a crazy, but I value my freedom of speech and my privacy. 

That’s not to say I disagree with your point if now was the permanent state of the internet. I feel comfortable now expressing opinions and can do whatever I please without much evasion effort unless it’s like buying drugs. 

But that’s the result of constant effort by the FOSS community, the EFF, and other groups to slow this trend, along with court rulings on net neutrality and the like. And I think a hard line we all agree on should be non-threatening political speech. 

There needs to be an updating to our laws on internet freedoms because they do not represent the intents of our founding fathers. Things need to be codified rather than held on the tenuous hope that Amazon and Google don’t choose to use the “we won’t host your service” move in unison on a less worthy target. 

As it stands, I use none of the major tech players when necessary, use extensive privacy and security measures, use open source, etc. Most people don’t take it seriously and I think that’s a shame but I understand, especially for people who aren’t informed on the admittedly complicated topics.

"Metcalfe's Law does directly link to the number of users so to some degree the number of users is part of the strength.  More users means more people who will buy it up if the price has a large price drop.  It also means more nodes so you have a stronger more robust decentralized network that can survive attacks and government censorship far better than a newer, less popular crypto.  It also means it is backed by the most hash power, which makes it far less vulnerable to a 51% attack as well.

The age speaks to the validity of the project and strength of the code security, something that other crypto currencies lack.  If it had just been some fad then it should have died out by now.  It should have died after Mt Gox.  Or after it was banned in at least a dozen countries including China and India.  Or after the last several crashes like when it went from $20k to ~$3,500.  If there was some critical security vulnerability in the code then hackers should have found it by now.  

And it should be pointed out that not all crypto's are intended to compete or replace bitcoin or other currencies.  You have many that are trying to be decentralized social media platforms, or video and file sharing or hosting platforms for example.  Or projects like Ethereum that is more of a decentralized Amazon Web server than a currency.

Ward has more than 40,000 followers for his conspiracy theory videos. It is unclear whether he gets a share of ad revenue from YouTube.

In one video, which carried adverts for Grammarly and Big Yellow Box storage, Ward claims that the vaccine is causing mass deaths and was created by Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, to reduce the world’s population.

“I knew they were going to shut down the world’s economy for a global financial reset,” he says. “I knew they were going to use the virus, the vaccine, the 5G, the riots and the alien invasion as a smokescreen. I knew that.”

He says that people should resist the vaccine, even if it becomes necessary for travel. “I go to Africa a lot,” he says. “I’ve never had an injection going to Africa . . . never. Because I pay $100 not to, because the Africans are good boys. I say I want the certificate . . . straight through.”

He goes on to claim that doctors and nurses who have treated coronavirus patients or administered vaccines will one day be “held responsible” for genocide.

In the first 24 hours that the video was live on YouTube, it gained more than 13,000 views. He has over 40,000 subscribers on the site with more than 1 million total views.

Companies do not have control over the videos their advertisements are placed next to, although YouTube has a policy not to put advertising next to dangerous or derogatory content, including antivax and QAnon material.

A spokesman for Big Yellow Box said: “We are very disappointed to learn about this. We were not aware of it and it should not have happened given the safety measures in place for this form of advertising. We have suspended our advertising on YouTube with immediate effect until this is resolved.”

As well as running adverts alongside antivax content, The Times found examples of misinformation on other sites being promoted through paid advertisements on YouTube.

The silver lining is that if this trend catches on there will be a massive outcry for common sense change to outdated copyright laws.

"They can't use a lot of your data and a large oart of your data was aquired illegaly. But that doesn't mean they can't find means to monitize them.     


If Apple were to stockpile a billion Iphone 11s' that would result in losses. But Facebook can keep adding billions and billions of information to their stockpile untill it becomes legal or possible to use it for producs.               
 
If you look at smart home devices competition between Amazon and Google is pretty tight. But ultimately the company that gets to feed on the most data will control the market. Which I'd be suprised if it isn't Google.

There is money in insurance and Facebook selling information on phone use while driving sure sounds illegal but imagine the benefits to society if text and drive people had to pay more for car insurance than hands free drivers.

"&gt;Facebook product is data. Apples is hardware.

This is just flat out untrue. If you look at the profit margin on in iPhone, its $55 billion in revenue per year is not possibly more profitable than its services, which produce $43 billion a year in revenue at a clearly much lower cost and higher profit margin.

And Facebook's power is in propagation of information.

Apple's entire company is built on its brand, Facebook has some level of ability of making that brand appear stale solely by serving users with other users negative opinions on the company. If Apple users think Apple is becoming uncool, they'll use something else. Then what are they going to rely on? Their shitty, overpriced hardware?

The fact that their most profitable division (services) is entirely dependent on their hardware division, is actually a bad thing.

"Marxism is not itself an economic theory, it’s a mode of analysis - in Marxist theory, Fascism is the natural end stage of all capitalist states. The Soviets and their satellites used an economic theory called “Command Economy,” where planners try to use consumption data to determine demand and adjust supply accordingly. Taken together with Vanguard Theory, this is what people call Marxist-Leninism. I don’t think there are any states left using the model but there is a fantastic argument to be made that with the kind of “Big Data” that Walmart and Amazon are sitting on, command economies could well be more efficient than their predecessors. There is a style of fascism that incorporates something called “corporatism” where instead of centering economic life on laissez-faire markets, the primary actors are instead various stakeholders.

Steam isn’t necessarily beneficial of its own accord, although many monopolies are good in many ways in their adolescence; Steam is basically at the whim of the firms (game designers) who provide their products on the marketplace, and Steam make a consistent endeavor to remain a favorable marketplace for the community by appealing to both the firms and the users because there are consistently other sharks circling (Amazon, Google, Microsoft) who are more capable of filling Steam’s place in the market if the game publishers decide to move elsewhere.

If you view steam as a provider firm rather than a simple marketplace, then it can be said that Steam has all of the market-optimization obligations of a firm in competition because other firms have alreafy surmounted the barriers to entry in the market and begun making use of the economies of scale available due to their work in adjacent markets (general software distribution), and all of the provider-satisfaction obligations of a buyer with a tentative [monopsony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopsony) that’s living on a knife’s edge.",1613285124.0,1

"Apple is a full service vendor that provides partnerships for development on their intellectual property.  Another equivalent would be a chain of car dealerships that only takes consignment of vehicles built on a specific drive chain.  There are lots of dealerships, lots of places to sell vehicles, but this dealership chain has a specific warranty system and quality control guarantee that is appealing to a subset of customers.  Epic signed a contract stating they would provide a commission for all products built on the drive chain to which Apple owns the rights.  Epic then put a poison pill into vehicles that violates the sales agreement by sending all secondary sales items that were part of the deal with Apple to a back alley vendor.

Apple owns the OS, it is their intellectual property.  Apple has a devoted subset of a marketplace largely based on the security and reliability of the products they sell.  Apple runs an exclusive shop for their intellectual property.

Epic was caught red handed violating their contract with Apple.  Their defense has been not only do they not have to abide by the contract, nobody should have to do so to access a niche market.

I’ll go back to the retailer example again.  Walmart doesn’t have to carry Costco brands.  Walmart owns exclusive control of what goes on their shelves.  Walmart could choose to carry such brands but nobody can force them to do so.  Further, nobody can force them to do so for free.  This is the walled garden concept.

Apple is well within their rights to exclude access to their marketplace.  Apple only removed the Epic product because of millions of dollars in commission owed by Epic as stipulated in the contract.  The Epic case didn’t have enough credibility to get a temporary injunction.  That’s an incredibly low bar to meet.

Third party applications could form their own launching system.  It would be difficult and would violate Apple’s OS IP, they in no way license their products for this.  It could be done though, that’s not the case we’re talking through here.

Scammers can even list their company name as something totally fake like “Target Inc,” “Lego LLC,” or “Bed Bath and Beyond” with zero repercussions as far as i know. 

They’re then able to sell fake stuff because they have more collective “unique” reviews than Amazon actually has users on their platform. Amazon fails to verify claims to legitimacy so often that i’ve had to filter through pages worth of knockoffs every time i search for a product.

"My personal methodology for searching items on Amazon is to just ignore the 3, 4, and 5 star reviews. I just ASSUME that if I'm looking at the product at all, it does what it says it does and likely does it well.

If there's 1,000 reviews and 50 of them are 1-star, but it looks like they are just random stuff like: ""Arrived broken."", ""Shipping was slow."", ""I ordered Rose-Red and got Red-Red."". In that case, I can assume it otherwise is probably fine. In the 'arrived broken' case, shit happens. Make enough of something, you'll inevitably ship a bad one.

And it's not the original vendors fault of one of the second hand retailers or alt vendors is actually selling widget GR77435CA (black), the version built for the chinese market that happens to have shitty capacitors that pop easily.

I mean the most likely just do what they did in some other stricter markets like Germany or Netherlands and make seller acceptance manual for those markets. That said knowing Amazon business model they probably had an army of layers making sure they cannot be held liable for anything else they wouldn't open in Sweden they would open somewhere nearby. Let's say Estonia and offer to ship to Sweden. 

What makes this hard for consumers is that when you log in to Amazon most people don't seem to understand less than 50% of the stuff is sold by Amazon, lot of is 3rd party sellers shipping from Amazon warehouse or from their own.

New Dad. Shopping for baby products on Amazon pissed me off. The reviews generally went “This is a good product” to “this will kill your child!” Little was in between. And of course people would say the “impending child death” reviews were helpful. I appreciated that IKEA’s website gave people the option of saying a review was NOT helpful - which came out in force when a read a crib review that went like this “This crib worked well for our three children - then during a party two four year olds decided to jump on it breaking it Two-stars.” Um....That is a YOU problem - not IKEA’s.,1613482411.0,1

"Just as a counterpoint, I think I probably do 75% of my non-grocery shopping on Amazon, 15% at Kohl's, 7% at Menard's and about 3% somewhere else. I've ordered hundreds of different items on Amazon and rarely have I received something I'm unhappy with. Also, on those occasions I do have a gripe, I've never had an issue returning an item. In many cases I contact support and they give me the refund and tell me to keep the item. Now, I am a Prime member, and that probably makes a big difference. But I've been quite happy with them, despite the fact they've practically destroyed their competition over the last two decades. 

What I do to avoid crappy products is read reviews of verified buyers, comparison shop, and make an educated guess. I always read the negative reviews and give them more weight than the positives. Ordering items that offer prime shipping means I probably avoid a bunch of smaller unknown shops where I'm more likely to get a knock off or lousy product. I also read reviews from other sites, and if it's something more complicated than a piece of Ikea furniture, I read Reddit/forums or Consumer Reports, and check the BBB for negative company reviews. But again, their return policy is great and super simple, and since I already shop at Kohl's often enough, on the occasion I have to ship something back, it's no big deal.",1613482884.0,-1

No. It doesn't. Tell me how much economic advantage Philadelphia gained by not offering Amazon enough of a tax inventive to attract the new Amazon headquarters. Buisness is good, period. When you don't offer a tax incentive you get nothing. That's reality, and its only going to get worse as the world becomes more globalized. Countries are competing with other countries, states are competing with other states, and cities are competing with other cities. If you don't offer an incentive to a company, that company will go somewhere else. That's why tech corporations are leaving places like CA in droves. It's definitely possible to go too far.

"Courts do not require a literal monopoly before applying rules for single firm conduct; that term is used as shorthand for a firm with significant and durable market power — that is, the long term ability to raise price or exclude competitors. That is how that term is used here: a ""monopolist"" is a firm with significant and durable market power. Courts look at the firm's market share, but typically do not find monopoly power if the firm (or a group of firms acting in concert) has less than 50 percent of the sales of a particular product or service within a certain geographic area. Some courts have required much higher percentages. In addition, that leading position must be sustainable over time: if competitive forces or the entry of new firms could discipline the conduct of the leading firm, courts are unlikely to find that the firm has lasting market power.

I’ll break it down Barney style for you:

Twitter and Parker are direct competitors in the digital marketplace.

Amazon hosts both Twitter and Parler on its web servers.

Amazon has stock ownership interest in Twitter.

Amazon kicks Parler off of its servers, effectively defeating Twitter’s competition and protecting its ownership interest.

"I work in an Amazon facility in NC. We are encouraged to get tested every single week, but most people don’t. Amazon can’t force you to take a test or a vaccine. (I take the tests) They are free of charge for employees.

If you find out you have COVID, you are immediately asked to leave the building and are given 2 weeks pay to stay away. 

If someone in your department or someone you’ve had close contact with gets it, they Chime or text you and ask you to stay away until you can prove you are negative (typically 2 or 3 days, but they will excuse up to 5 days). This has happened to me, I tested negative.

There is a Safety team who walks around and makes sure everyone wears their masks and stays six feet away, but they can’t be everywhere at once and I see people pull their masks back down as soon as they walk away. There’s also a guy who looks like an exterminator who walks around with a big tank of spray that constantly disinfects any area where no one is standing. This disinfectant spray damages the inner seals of the machines we work on, so the rack lights are constantly needing to be replaced, and they’re crazy expensive.

In some cases, a warehouse drove profits. In others, it offset the costs of the warehouse, didn't *cost* Amazon anything. While the warehouse didn't ""earn"" money it took sales away from their competitors. If it isn't putting money *into* Amazon's pockets, per se, it's keeping those sales from going to Walmart and Target.

"Yeah. I'm not sure why I am being downvoted for simply sharing my experience so I'd be happy to explain. I worked at what is called a ""Supplemental"" warehouse for Amazon. Basically, we were the warehouse that would hold on to overstocked and larger items that couldn't go to the main Amazon warehouse until they were ordered by customers.

These ""Supplemental"" facilities are set up in existing warehouse spaces that are owned by other companies that Amazon rents from, thus all the fixtures in these warehouses are temporary setups. Areas are separated with fences rather than walls. Plywood, folding chairs/tables make up the break rooms and offices, etc. With these temporary setups can come really dangerous situations after being in place for long periods of time. Loose cables/wires running across the floor, pieces of shelving coming apart and sometimes falling on employees, just to name a few examples.

It goes without saying that on top of that, little to no COVID-19 policies were followed nor enforced by my management team. From talking with employees in the little time I was there, the had been dealing with a COVID outbreak in the warehouse just a few weeks prior.

I'm not saying my experiences are what everybody has experienced working for Amazon but it certainly gave them a bad rap in my eyes. Again, these are just my personal experiences so I don't want anyone to assume that is what it is going to be like for them.",1613595531.0,1

You're really stretching the definition by including something like COVID in there. For example, the pollution created by a coal power plant's waste water is usually considered an external cost, but the pollution from energy usually isn't because every industry requires energy and the energy is indeed being bought by those companies.

But even if we assume for a minute that Amazon *is* externalizing COVID-related healthcare costs by existing during a pandemic, how does that somehow change the fact that voting with your wallet effects Amazon's bottom line, and is thus the best way for consumers to make their voice heard? As I already stated, the state has done its part by suing Amazon.

We don't ignore externalities just because they're ubiquitous, (otherwise nobody would talk about the costs of carbon pollution and they obviously do) so there's no reason to ignore societal costs due to the increase in risks to the health of employees brought about by the failure of companies to adopt required covid safety guidelines.",1613597861.0,1

2) Chances are you have anywhere between 2,000 to 5,000 employees in your building. Statistically, 7% of these people will contract COVID. If they ONLY go to Amazon and nowhere else, that statistic falls to less than 1%. You cannot say that all of your coworkers are complying with state/county guidelines. You can expect *some* of your coworkers to get COVID. They also have families and friends who also may not be compliant. Some Amazonians hang out together outside of work hours.

I've seen perfectly fine pieces of equipment equivalent to my annual salary tossed in the trash because a department can't buy a new one if they still have the old one and if they don't spend the money on the new one this year, they won't get as much money next year. In governement sales we literally have promotions for fiscal year end spending. It's a free for all, all the state vendors work to scoop up any and all dollars cause God forbid the governement not spend every cent they collect. 

Then I come home and read an article about how some politician thinks we should pay a $3 tax for an Amazon delivery cause the MTA ran out of money again and I want to scream. I do think people benefit from state spending. But we still have to ask if what we're spending makes sense for what we're getting. Our subway for example, costs twice as much to run then similar systems in other major cities like Tokyo and London. Is our subway twice as good? Is it even...as good? Arguably no. $6B for a police department that rivals the military of a small nation, too bad it's racist and kills people. We spend twice as much as the national average per student and our schools in NYC suck, to put it lightly. An extra billion dollars toward mental health services, but that doesn't seem to be getting better.

You could argue that the closing of the call center was a coincidence - that they would have closed anyway but then explain all the money Amazon spends on law firms specializing in anti Union strategies, printing all the flyers denouncing the Unions, and all the during work hour meetings while denying the Unions an equal foothold to defend itself. Just recently there was a job listing for new employees to scour social media (private Facebook pages) and report back the chatter.

"No, people aren’t investing in Uber for their development.  They’re investing in them because they will have already completely penetrated the markets they need to in order to be the dominant force in driverless ride hailing.

Much like how Amazon famously functioned on a loss for so many years.  People weren’t investing in Amazon because they would be the only player in online distribution, but they were certainly the biggest by a huge margin.

Uber is in the same situation.  There will certainly be alternatives to Uber when driverless cars finally get here properly, but Uber and it’s investors are doing everything they can to make sure they are the Amazon of ride hailing.  

Personally I don’t see this ruling changing that.  Even if they did decide to pull out of the UK, it wouldn’t be because of the losses in that one area.  It would be because it would set a precedent they would have to answer for in every lawsuit until the end of time.  They know if they cave now that they give up their power. 

Frankly, I think Uber thinks they have more power than they actually do.  If pulling out is meant to send a message, the only message will be that they are replaceable.

My personal view is that regulating Uber/Lyft and gig jobs is a cop-out. The real problem is that the country doesn't have a proper social safety net to make gig work viable. If people got healthcare and benefits from the state, then we wouldn't have to worry so much about jobs with poor benefits.

The ruling was in 2017, they've been operating under these requirements since then, all that has happened now is they have had their appeal denied.

&gt;You have most of the control of the terms of business

That's literally not true. Uber lay down all of the requirements, you can make zero requests/demands/etc. of them. You're explicitly forbidden to provide driving services directly for clients - if that doesn't prove you're not ""just self employed"", I don't know what would.

&gt;including when you work and what rides you take.

You say including there as if there's more. That's pretty much all you get a say in, but not even universally. You're required to accept a certain number of jobs provided to you, or you get removed from the service (temporarily or permanently). Once you accept a job, you're not in control of the route you take; you have to drive the route Uber dictates.

&gt;Would you really want another driver bidding 5 cents less then you every time you try to take a ride?

If they're self employed and simply offering lifts to people for a fee, yeah, that's certainly something that could happen. Why shouldn't somebody be able to choose to charge less if they want to in an effort to ensure that they get business.

You want to use Amazon and Craigslist as examples, do you think either of those enforce a price that you have to charge? Because they don't.

&gt;It's not a loophole to not provide paid leave to people who use your services but are not employed by you.

They've spend hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying for the ability to claim their drivers aren't employed by them.

&gt;Fundamentally, it seems you want to force people to work for corporations, so you can then mandate corporations provide the wages/benefits people need to be comfortable.

They already work for a corporation; Uber. Who tells them what to do? Who pays their wages? Like if that's not working for Uber, nothing is.

But yeah, what the fuck, why *wouldn't* you mandate that employers pay reasonable wages and offer paid leave? Corporations or otherwise.

&gt;Personally, I'd much rather the government provide an adequate social safety net for people, rather then relying on businesses.

You can charge someone whatever you want to drive them anywhere, but if you want to use Uber's service you have to agree to their rules. (Same as the riders do, who also aren't employees)

Amazon has plenty of restrictions and requirements for sellers. Craigslist is more wild-west. Different businesses take different approaches, and that's fine.

The crisis is looming, we're too complacent, and these bad solutions only serve to make people believe the solution is simple. It's not. It will be painful.

"&gt; should companies like Google even be allowed to have this kind of power? 

This is why things are going to be so interesting over the next decade+.     IMO, the Internet broke capitalism.

I became involved with the Internet in 1986.    I started with Bitnet in 1985 and switched over.

Me and most people thought the Internet was going to empower the little guy.    I use to do a lot of presenting on the Internet around the globe in the early days.

We constantly talked about how the Internet leveled the playing field.   But we were completely wrong.   It has ended up being the exact opposite.

Before the Internet in the physical world it was a lot harder to have concentration.    There was a natural barrier.

The connectivity of the Internet is what has enabled the mega corporations like Google, FB, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon.

Right now as I type this the largest companies in the world are dominated by tech companies.   

So they are already mega corporations.  But look at the latest financial results.   Last quarter Google reported they increase profits by more than 40% YoY.  That is NOT a typo.  Google is already just HUGE and yet still able to grow top line by over 20% and bottom line by over 40%!!!!

But what people do not realize is these companies have barely even got started.   Companies like Google and Amazon have tons and tons and tons of runway to work with.

These companies also own assets that are just can NOT be replicated.   Perfect example is YouTube.     

What I believe should be done is a special tax applied to all the big tech companies.    I believe this will ultimately happen but it is a long time off.

The tax should be used to fund a UBI.   The thing that has not yet happened is the job loss.  That will eventually happen.   

The most common job in the US is driving.   Those jobs will go away when you have.

"&gt; I’ll accept that when Linux, et.al. are as ubiquitous and easy to use as IOS or Windows. Right now they are limited to use by tech people who are donating their time. Hardly a business model; and an exception to the rule.

You're limiting yourself to consumer devices. In the server space, that's nearly 100% linux. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc. all run Linux. Additionally, Android is a heavily modified Linux, so technically, it's running on a majority of the world's phones.

&gt; Also, Gnome looks like a Russian knockoff of windows 95. Hardly innovative.

Many innovations actually come from the opensource world. If you're happy about using some kind of app store or central repository to install your apps/software, that's been in the linux world for more than 2 decades.

Elasticsearch (previously mentioned) is probably what's running your internal search, tracking your server logs, etc.

"&gt; This is not that, according to the article. It states that the people who accept this bonus are eligible for rehire... after the union vote.

No it does not. The article linked above doesn't mention any thing one way or anything about them being eligible for rehire. Here'e the entire text of the article:

___

&gt; As the historic union election at Amazon in Alabama heats up, Amazon is pulling all the tricks to stop the union. 

&gt; In violation of Amazon’s social distancing policy, Amazon has forced workers to attend anti-union meetings and sent workers constant text messages daily, hinting that a union could possibly lead to the warehouse closing. Amazon has even gotten the local authorities to shorten the time of stoplights outside of the plant so that union organizers can’t hand out pro-union literature so that union organizers can’t hand out pro-union literature easily to workers passing in their cars. 

&gt; Now, Amazon is doing something that labor observers have never seen before in a union election; they are offering $2,000 “resignation bonuses” to quit. 

&gt; Last night, workers throughout the plant received emails offering them bonuses if they simply quit their jobs. The emails offer workers, who worked for 2 peak seasons, at least $2,000 to quit. If workers have been there at least 3 peak seasons, they are offering them $3,000. 

&gt; Some Amazon workers, who dislike their job at the warehouse, may find the bonuses a tempting bridge to quit their job and seek something better. Workers are even being told that if they quit now that they could regain their jobs later after the union election.

&gt; However, if workers quit now, they won’t be eligible to vote in the ongoing union election.  In the meantime, many labor observers expect that Amazon will seek to hire replacements that will vote solidly anti-union.

&gt; “That should be illegal, how can you pay someone to resign,” says 48-year-old Black Amazon worker Jennifer Bates  “They are going all the way, they are pulling out all the stops”.

&gt; Under federal labor law, the bonuses could be considered a bribe and could lead to the union election being thrown out. Employers are strictly forbidden from improving the material conditions of workers in the lead up to elections and the “resignation bonuses” could be grounds for the union to petition the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to order a new union election if RWDSU loses this round. 

&gt; “The NLRB routinely finds violations for ‘conferring benefits’ to induce employees not to vote for a union during the “critical period” between the time the election petition is filed and the election is held,” says University of Wyoming Labor Law Professor Mike Duff, a former prosecutor for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). 

&gt; However, the bonuses could backfire on Amazon. Some union supporters have used the offer of the bonuses to argue that Amazon could easily afford to pay workers more if the company desired to. 

&gt; “If you know that they need it, why don’t you give it to them anyway as a bonus,” adds Bates. 

&gt; Union organizers are nervous, but despite the intimidation and anti-union tactics, they aren’t deterred in their fight to unionize.

&gt; “I think there is this wall in front of me right now. And it’s because I can’t see what’s on the other side,” says Bates of the union election set to end on March 30th. “And I think a lot of times in life, that’s when you really have to take a step. Because just because you don’t see what’s on the other side doesn’t mean that’s not victory”.",1613969974.0,1

I do 100% think they should be paid better and have better working conditions, just think it is disingenuous to use the valuation of a massive company that has different arms to relate to the pay of workers in a particular sector. 

Amazon web services and Amazon media are both worth $500+ billion each. I also think that AWS alone generates more than 60% of Amazon’s profit. So in reality the retail sector is only worth $500-600 billion, not $1.6 trillion. And that retail sectors profits would be less than 1/3 of Amazon’s profits. Amazon had $31 billion in free cash flow for the 12 months leading into their last earnings report. If we say 1/3 of that was from retail then that’s about $10B. 

Anyways, I am behind the workers getting more, just feel like it’s better to use realistic numbers.

Realistically, 10-20k would be a starting point on an individual basis. But in the larger sense, if they make a successful union and unions begin to spread through their warehouses, probably hundreds of thousands per person would be reasonable place to start.

"I really don’t understand what that has to do with my comment. This comment thread started about warehouse workers hypothetically being paid at least $2,000 more and you saying Amazon is worth $1.6T so obviously they could afford it. My comment was just to point out that the arm of Amazon that employs the warehouse workers who would be the benefactors of said $2,000 is only worth 1/3 or maybe less of the $1.6T number you quoted.

Basically, for the purposes of wage negotiations, you can’t really count the profits/value that come from a separate arm of the business like AWS and use that number for determine remuneration in a totally different branch like retail. Sure, maybe a company has a loss making arm that they subsidize to an extent for some reason like brand recognition in auto racing, but that’s not really a thing you can count on. If retail workers tried to negotiate pay based on the total company’s profit margin which is heavily subsidized by other branches of the business that are much more profitable, then it would make sense for Amazon to just spin off either AWS or retail into a separate company. Again, I’m sure there’s ample cash to treat employees of all stripes better. But this comment chain was just me pointing out that the entire company’s value can’t reasonably be used when determining how much is available for compensating the workers of a particular branch of the company, in this case retail.",1613976562.0,1

Therefore the value of Amazon as a whole company isn’t relevant to how much they can afford to pay workers in a given arm of the company.

1,000 times more than what you're saying in this comment. Amazon's total employee count two years ago was around 575,000. If you took 1 billion dollars and divided it evenly across all those people. Just 1 billion of the roughly 6-11 billion dollar profits Amazon has reported in each of the last few years. Everyone could get an extra 1.7k. If they gave up half of 11 billion - everyone gets nearly 10k more a year.

Now the pay alone isn't the issue though. They also have godawful work conditions and insane amounts of physical and mental stress put on them. If even half of the anecdotes are true then it's a fucking nightmare company to work for.

But it's important to recognize, part of the reason they have such high profits is that they are exploiting their own workers. Without that exploitation, the profits evaporate quite quickly. They have so many employees that offering them decent wages and benefits even hitting some bare minimum of decency - they'd risk losing part of their edge.

This is why the dragons fight so hard to keep their hoards safe from us peasants.

"I am a Criminal Justice major and worked mainly in law firms and also supervised the grading of the standardized essay tests in schools across the nation back when that bad idea had just gotten going. And I spent the last ten years taking care of my mom after she had a series of out of the blue strokes. I was her only child and just lost her March 29th. 

And several of my dearest decades long friends are Union Ironworkers-a Dad and his two sons and an ex was a Pipefitter in Florida at the power plants. So was my ex brother in law. 

And I had a neighborhood buddy when I was growing up that absolutely burned with anger at the mention of Unions. 

I also was near Kentucky when the powers that be pulled that slick move that all but wiped out teachers’ retirements, many of whom were counting on that package in mere several years! Snuck in on the back or amid an eleventh hour routine sewer bill and I’m ashamed to say I’m not sure of the status cuz that’s when I had to leave to be with my mom but I know I was so grateful that their Union was fighting hard for that snake bullshit move. They were watching for something shady to go down with that crowd. They just didn’t anticipate just how low they could or would go. The law that allows that is rarer even than filibustering. The two of them existing at all were always two of my biggest shockers to learn in school. 

But anyway...

 I’ve also seen-as we all have-extremely powerful unions protect the employ of their people that had no business being anywhere near that line of work...sometimes/many times they shouldn’t have been near ANY line of work other than maybe the laundry facilities of their forever home correctional institution. 

And I’ve seen the Union101 (Silkwood/Coal Miners’ Daughter etc movies multiple times and/or read or watched basics and of course ten plus years in Kentucky I’ve heard some horror stories.  

My heart breaks everytime I hit certain stretches through West Virginia and the remnants of the horrors of those families whose patriarchs and brothers sons cousins hit those damn mines and thought they made it the American Dream. I imagine them saying, “Ma Daddy do you believe it home ownership for my family who knew a big ole dummy from the hollars like me could make it.”

And his folks and wife and so on were so proud. And he (times millions)deserved to have that pride from them and about himself and that chest out walk. People underestimate the special breed of person-especially in those early early days-that it takes to go under the earth of a giant living breathing hot effing rock that could have dropped down to Satan himself for all anyone knew. And you go down there day after day for the rest of your able to walk life and you see injuries and horrors and that they may have shared some of it but I bet very few have shared all of it or the worst of what they watched or went through down there. 

Plus even if whey wanted to get it off their chest or question some stuff they’d probably think, “nah I better not. I’d never wanna get Mr Jim caught up in something. He’s been so wonderful to me and my family him and his company...I wouldn’t have any of this without him...” 

Loyalty begets Loyalty and all that.

In seeing this escalating Amazon issue and my 18 year old daughter who’s normally very reserved private about her views but she opened up a dialogue very disappointed with them (Amazon)and, like I said, despite my apparent glaring stupidity about the subject in-depth, I somehow still managed to get a Criminal Justice Degree and Paralegal Certificate so she’s used to hearing my opinions on various issues and case laws and all that good stuff in support or not of whatever it may be and I was really disappointed in myself that I could not engage with her. 

And like I said, my lack of knowledge is also really disrespectful to my fellow humans and  their families so strongly across the board and I also owe it to them to educate myself. And hear their stories and perspectives. 

I kept my OP what I tried to be respectfully short so I could educate myself more and better grateful to hear everyone’s stories and experiences. I think I said that. I was looking forward to it. Instead I just spent the whole morning trying to undo how stupid and un American I was made to feel.

"Not really. The difference is that in Europe they also don't force-feed unions what are called ""exclusive bargaining"" clauses which compel the union to bargain for everyone. In Europe, when a non-member gets in trouble, the union can sit back and watch management do whatever they're going to do. There's a real incentive to join because membership acts like an insurance policy against unfair treatment. In america when a non-member gets in trouble the union has a duty to represent them to the same degree they do members. That means there's very little incentive for a worker to join the union. They can freeload and get all the same benefits that members get. This effectively hamstrings unions in RTW states because they have to spend almost the same amount of money negotiating, administering and litigating contracts while less money is coming in. In Europe they spend less when they have less members. 

Lacking EB clauses also means that unions in Europe don't have to reach a critical mass and hold an election in order to represent people. They can bargain on behalf of just a portion of the workforce assuming that portion is large enough to get the employer's attention. Take this warehouse as an example; the union there got more than half the employees to sign an authorization card, and maybe even an application to join the union. In Europe, they would've immediately started to leverage the company into sitting down for negotiations on the threat that if they didn't those workers wouldn't show up for work the next day. Amazon would hammer out a contract for those workers and anyone in that union would reap those benefits while Amazon could choose not to extend anything extra to anyone not in that union. They'd probably pay everyone the same to keep membership in the union down, but still anyone not in the union would not have the unions protection should they be disciplined. In the United States, that union has to receive the consent of over half the workers who vote in the election in order to bargain on behalf of ALL the workers in that facility, and any contract would immediately confer the same benefits and union protections upon every worker there. 

Without exclusive bargaining clauses, more than one union can operate within a facility at the same time. Maybe one group of workers is concerned about retirement benefits while another is more concerned about wages. So some folks are gonna join the union whose contract focuses on a strong pension while others join one that's focused on getting as much money as possible. In the US, everyone is mixed together and gets the same thing, so in plenty of places there's grumbling about low wages for people getting awesome pensions because some need the money now.

Moreover, what makes you think the other job opportunities available to a soon-to-be-former-Amazon-worker are any better than the conditions they presently face at Amazon? The anti-union attitude in the US isn't constrained to Amazon, nor are the shitty work conditions that nudge people toward the idea of unionizing in the first place.

"That's not really the point, is it? Besides the fact that the UN's declaration on human rights isn't really the US' jam, it's also almost completely irrelevant to the point I'm making. Unions, I'll reiterate, did not initially arise in any environment that gave them the legal right to exist, nor any legal powers to negotiate or take any action whatsoever. The weren't legal entities, their actions weren't legal, they weren't recognized legally, and their existence and their membership wasn't a declared right. Now whether or not you feel unionization is a right or not is kind of irrelevant, as it is with water, free speech, the right to counsel, etc. None of our rights are actually guaranteed, none of them are unable to be infringed, none of them are natural laws like gravity. They're rights. You don't get them by sitting on a couch all day, every last one of them was won with a *hard* fight. 

Whether or not the US recognizes unionization as a right matters very little. What actually matters is whether or not the US is willing to do anything to preserve it, or if they'll just send in the national guard to shoot pro-unionization protestors as they are historically speaking, wont to do. And beyond that, beyond the question of whether the law and the enforcers of laws will actually do anything helpful, let alone avoid doing everything in their power to do the opposite of helping, is the simple reality that unionization *doesn't need laws*. It *doesn't need rights*. Unionization simply *is*, completely independently of the legal environment surrounding it. 

Whether or not unionization is a recognized right, whether or not it's legal or explicitly illegal, unionization has exactly the same impact. The power of a union doesn't come from laws, but from the fact that the workers *always* control the means of production, whether or not they own it. The workers, in fact, are the means of production. Even with automation, that's still true, and all automation actually does is to consolidate control over the mechanisms of profit generation into the hands and the minds of fewer and fewer workers. Somewhere within Amazon, are a few underpaid workers with the keys to the entire kingdom. They can shut down AWS, delete backups, torch archives, wipe databases, or break configuration in ways that none of the suits will have any idea how to fix. Whether or not they have the ""right"" to do so, the workers can strike, they can destroy or disable machinery, they can even engage in a literal armed shooting war against their employers. They can bring the money train to a screeching halt, quite easily. And when that happens, what the law says has nothing to do with anything. The bosses will do whatever they can to get the money train moving again. Make no mistake, acquiescing to the worker's demands will be the very last thing they try, but eventually, they will try it.

Unions aren't really protected in America. What laws we do have to empower unions, more than anything, bind them. They say ""you can only do this and that for so long and under these circumstances."" But unions didn't come about in the first place with these laws, and they don't actually bind them any more than they did when they didn't exist, because, again, the power of a union is a natural power, a consequence of how profit generation structures have to work under capitalism.",1614005800.0,1

And, that presumes that the $2000 is actually to keep people from joining the union.

"&gt;Seriously, fuck Amazon - how much would it hurt them to pay a livable wage

in competing with walmart's curbside pickup and online sales? A lot.

I get the anger but the solution is the rules, not the player.
When you play monopoly, you use the same rules as all the other players.. even as you get wealthy. you dont suddenly say ""ill pay more when i land on your spots, cause i can afford it""... no you pay what the rules tell you to pay.

Sure sure in a perfect utopian world everyone would try to pay their employees a living wage based on the goodness of their hearts and would all try to compete on that level playing field.. totally designed by good will.

back in reality, where if you can glitch through a building to kill another player you damn well will, even though that glitch def should not exist.. we can hope for businesses to just do the right thing, especially when doing the right thing makes them less competitive against competitors that dont give a fuck about doing the right thing either.

which is why we need things like min wage regs.

we could have hoped and prayed that corps stop working 10 year olds to death, but nothing would have worked except the laws that banned it. Game theory says if there is a way to get a leg up on competition, a large number of people will use it. The only fix, is to legislate away that leg up. Like its often cheaper to get metals that have a lot of lead in them. So we regulate how much lead your metal can have in it, and you can still make it into a baby spoon. If we didnt, people who wanted more profits, would get shit metal and kids would suffer. Good will be damned.. you cant depend on it, so we legislate it.",1614015162.0,1

"If you just looked at Bezo’s “salary pay” it’s like $81k per year I read.  But if you are including his income from the shares he owns in Amazon, then Bezo’s makes about $13.4 million per hour!

"Just to make it clear, you don't have much privacy with Signal. Messages may be encrypted, but even if that encryption was the strongest in the world, that'd be only a tiny part of the picture: by being the central point through which all communication transits, Signal knows who talks to whom, how often, if that's just text, or image, videos, or calls, they can detect from usage patterns if you are rather in your bed, at work or on a toilet, sending love messages or talking business. Amazon knows all that as well, of course, courtesy of Signal running on AWS.

Using a VPN might hide from your ISP the fact that you are using Signal, but you can't hide from Signal while using it. This point is exactly why centralized networks can't ever be ""private"" (as opposed to federated ones like XMPP): you won't ever be able to hide from whoever is offering you the service, so the larger and more diverse the ecosystem of service providers, the less practical it is to be consistently snooped upon (and the lower the incentive for service providers to do so).

Second of all I don't know who hurt you but I've been working entry level jobs since I was 16, with no references.

Besides the ones where I had to work in the rain, I wouldn't describe any of them as unsatisfactory, by capitalism standards. This type of shit is a symptom of capitalism, so we can try to change the fundamental nature of it, say fuck it, or disengage. No one's going to do the first, you cant live in America and do the second, and there's plenty of reasons why an ingrained capitalist can't just disengage, their physical wellbeing one of them.

Lastly, the conditions at Amazon, while vastly underpaid, are not surprising, out of the ordinary, or some sort of one off special event of corporate capitalism. They never ever ever should have banned unions and its sketchy, and their practices are sketchy, but alot of people I know, and at my time at Amazon, it wasn't any different than any other entry level job: Tons of work, less than great pay. No care about the employee, no care for their plight, and no will to help them if they did care. If you subscribe to capitalism, these are the things you deal with if you don't play the game. It's fucked up and it sucks and the symptoms of this system have me in bed sobbing. It weighs heavily on me at night when I'm alone, but I have to eat dude.

I go into somewhere that signify they're hiring and apply and schmooze. I am not in school so I have  every day to dedicate to my job if they needed, which isn't actually far off. Most people work 5 days. Or I go on indeed and mass apply. Anything that doesn't indicate I would be denied if I were to be on probation or a felon.

So it's back to the Jolly Roger and my ""*arr"" suite of Docker images. Ironically, without paying for access to the million services, I don't see any ads for any new shows.

"The convenience of Amazon is that you only need one app, to get almost any product delivered to your door. It's a ""one stop shop"" done online.

Think about it: often times it's actually much cheaper to physically go visit a 99cent store to buy a product, but then you'd have to leave the house and waste 30 minutes of your day. People want the convenience of just ordering it on Amazon from their phone/laptop. They never have to go anywhere and can get nearly anything delivered, and often times with free next day delivery.

"I was just talking to a coworker on how I wish we had a Frys or Microcenter here. Our closest Microcenter is in Kansas City.

Best Buy in the 90s was awesome in my adolescence. Then in the 2000's they turned into the warranty / upselling garbage and I stopped shopping there. Then recently - I've had to use them for IT work where we need something -today- and can't wait for Amazon. I was impressed with how things changed and how it's run now. At least for my stores.

I would like Best Buy to explore the possibility of expanding their 'tech section' in cities where there isn't a microcenter. Seems like a possible niche could be filled.",1614189516.0,1

" 

Going to Fry's up til about 5 years ago was my happy place. Just fun to walk around and see everything, using some obscure part I needed as an excuse.

But in recent years, the stores had become depressing, with shelves sparse or even entirely empty. The computer section where they used to show off dozens of laptops and PCs for sale was down to literally one area with maybe 3-4 cheap laptops. What was mainly on sale was as seen on TV shit, B-movie DVDs, and crappy PC game collections.

When confronted with Amazon, Best Buy got its ass kicked for a while but then fought for its life, to some success. Fry's apparently just rolled over and died. Sure, they advertised price matching, but then would use any excuse they could to NOT price match such that I stopped even trying. Then I stopped going altogether, because being in their stores was such a bummer. I went for a final time last year and it looked like a store in the final days of a closing sale, with 75% of the place empty. I guess it pretty much was a closing sale given this news.

"The reason your getting downvoted is because microsoft and facebook are in so many things that you wouldn't know about on the surface that it wouldnt be an unfair estimate to say that both of them (and probably either of them) would constitute a connection with more than 50% of websites.

Amazon is mentioned not because of the marketplace, but because of amazon web services (AWS) which is probably just as interwoven with the net as microsoft and more than FB, because it hosts so much of the net. Google is that and more.

If you just took out google and microsoft you'd probably be down to less than 3% of the net and it would probably only be websites specifically made to not use any of their products, which would mean that they were for conspiracy theorists and otherwise angry folk.

I kept going in every month or two to see if I could get anything good on sale and I saw slowly how the store turned into an empty huge building. I can tell you that it was because everything they sold was online with sales and coupons that would bring the price down to what amazon and others were selling it for. It was not COVID that shut down Fry's it was that they couldn't get their products at a price were they could sell them at a reasonable price to make a profit and maintain their store and employees.

Haha, I was a *very* early adopter of Amazon for this very reason.

I had a gaming buddy that would do what he called the ""Fry's Upgrade"".  Every year he would buy the ""flagship"" video card from the same vendor, paying cash.  He would then take it home, carefully unbox it and then repackage the prior years card.  He did it in such a way that it looked like the box itself wasn't even opened. 

He did custom PC builds so he was in and out of Fry's all the time anyway, so he would return it and say the customer changed their mind or something.  Always wondered what the reaction was when someone figured out what what happened.  Or if Fry's would even take it back at that point, because it wasn't sold as a return.

"Fry's has been stuck in the 90s.  Back when distribution of components wasn't so widespread and PC Culture wasn't so mainstream.  Shit you can buy Mechanical Keyboards at Walmart today and they usually are the same price as Amazon.  

Fry's biggest value came during the late 90s and 2000s when PC Gaming culture started rapidly getting more popular but right before eCommerce became so practical.  They were a large, electronics specialty store but in the last 15 years they failed to really bridge that gap between the Brick &amp; Mortar era and the eCommerce era, something that Best Buy was able to do well for example.

What real reason would anyone have to go to a Fry's today?  Maybe if you're in a pinch and need something that day, but that's a pretty rare situation and even then you probably have a few other options for it.

Fry's had the ability to pivot their business model but they really didn't.  They got lazy from being a power player during a small window and failed to adapt.

"I put Fry’s on the same level as Circuit City used to be on (maybe Frys a bit better or like Circuit City in their hay-day).  Circuit City went out of business a long time ago now. 

It’s a very competitive of business sector, especially since stores like these are fighting against online retailers like Amazon and big brick and mortars like Best Buy/Walmart, both of which have massive buying power which keeps costs lower for bigger profit margin. Add to that this pandemic and a slow down in foot traffic and you have yourself a recipe for disaster for any company in that sector who was already hurting before the pandemic started. 

I think one reason micro center is still going strong (besides great word or mouth and products) is because they are very niche focused on PC market. The PC market is booming right now since we are all stuck home 24/7. Even people who used to go into work now have to beef up their home PC for business.

Fry's hasn't been the same for years now and I had already stopped visiting. A few years ago the one near me closed and the others cross-town just didn't have the merchandise stocked well as they use to. It was kind of easy to see the writing on the wall.

What I am going to miss are the non typical consumer items. I could go there on a moment's notice and get many electronics parts, particularly multimeters, oscilloscopes, and soldering irons. It was sort of the answer to Radioshack's closures, but better.

I hope some retailers can fill this gap. Microcenter is certainly the closest, but they didn't really the same items. Hardware stores have sub-par multimeters/soldering irons.

In my first few years before my early career job, that was largely travel based where I couldn't get packages on-site, Fry's was a common stop for last minute items.

For typical consumer merchandise, as long as it was priced competitively, I always tried to give them my business hoping it would help them work.

"So many memories. So many things... So many DVD's packs of 200, parts for my pc, buying stuff for home theatre, walking around just *being* at frys was like.. a thing. I loved going.

The last time i was there last year some time, the shelves were bare as hell and i didnt understand why. Now i realize they were a consignment retailer that would put items on the shelves they had yet to pay for, and thats why they had nothing..

And this was last year. At the only Frys in Washington State, in renton. I was actually there at the opening and it was a mad house. I was with my mother who was visiting, and my gf and my kid at the time and i litterally turned around after we got to the pc area and i lost them because it was shoulder to shoulder and there must have been thousands of people in this place.

I loved going to the home theatre department. They had this one room which was like a 100 person or more theatre with a huge screen, martin/logan sound, and theyd be showing great movies etc. 

While id usually just window shop there, or get stuff i needed right away and was willing to pay the extra difference... Over time they started to advertise price matching.

So id go, find what i wanted, id match it to amazon and the representative on the floor would match the price and print me out a tag. You could tell they hated doing that and it was always like i was inconviencing them or something, but hell if you want to make a sale and all that, then match teh price as you advertise on the huge ass banner outside of the store and ill buy what youre selling.

While im sad to see them go as i have so many fond memories and they are the last big store like that i bet we will ever have, i knew for a long time that the buisness model just wouldnt and couldnt last how they had it setup. With the right direction and etc.. maybe partner ships all that they could have done something since many people know their name.. its a sad day.

I just wonder how long microcenter will be around. Ive never been to one and i know theyre different and have more aggressive and competitive pricing etc.. I hope they dont go the way of frys but unless they keep up with the times, they will.

"Why are you asking how does removing Spotify improve things?  Who said it did?  (I don't see how removing Spotify has to do with the conversation, as I never suggested it.  But, without research, maybe the other services pay better.  I know Napster does.  So if Napster grew, that would help musicians.)

Spotify is not a free market.  Spotify is the one determining how much a song gets.  Further, two songs within Spotify can both get 1,000 plays, but will get paid differently.  The small musician will make less.

So it is not the people that are listening that are deciding how much a song is worth.

&gt; I think you should be paid the same per stream.

This is part of my point.  On Spotify, probably others, big musicians that are already making millions, will make more per play than a small musician.  

&gt; THAT was the original question; Spotify thinks raising prices leads to more piracy.

If you read the article, Spotify didn't just suddenly say, Hey, raising prices will cause more piracy.  The MPs are writing a report on music streaming.  ""It was set up last year to investigate whether musicians are being paid fairly by services like Spotify, Amazon Music and Apple Music.""

So this MP report might say Spotify is underpaying artist.  So just before the report is done or sent, they say We don't want to raise prices as that could lead to more piracy.  As if raising prices is the only way artist can be paid fairly.  And note that they aren't disputing that they aren't paid fairly.",1614213178.0,1

No wonder Amazon prices are 20% cheaper.

And then the small businesses go out of business since they can't compete with Amazon prices, and the monopoly grows. And it was solely enabled because the government offered them these unfair, uncompetitive advantages.

They were circling the drain struggling to survive with high prices and poor selection while Fry’s was still relatively competitive with lots of gadgets and a decent electronics/soldering section that put the only big chain alternative at the time (Radio Shack) to shame.

But then Fry’s started to slip and Micro Center rushed to fill in that void, while simultaneously heavily targeting the maker/3D printing market and undercutting Amazon on staples like hard drives and flash storage. I still can’t believe how dramatically they switched places, at least in my area it was maybe five years between Micro Center being an overpriced understocked ghost town compared to Fry’s relative success and vice versa. The last few years every time I went to Fry’s there was no one inside and entire sections were empty and roped off, I can’t imagine the pandemic helped in that regard.

I kind of hope someone will swoop in and buy up the assets to keep the company alive in some form or another, but I know that’s pretty unlikely. I could almost see Micro Center buying out the rights as a sister brand, but then again I think a big part of their success is probably due to the single-store-per-market strategy compared to Fry’s so that might not work. But if a reborn Fry’s could reposition themselves as a scaled-down dedicated enthusiast store (computer components, electronics parts, and maker-related stuff like 3D printing and robotics, without the general electronics or appliances) I think it could be come still be relatively successful.",1614219546.0,1

"&gt; Apple is literally doing the same thing as Microsoft with webkit.

Yeah and it probably would be anti-trust if Apple controlled more than 25% of the mobile market in many places.

Moreover just because they do anti-trust actions doesn't mean *this one* is.

&gt; Apple's play store is not like steam and ios is not like PC. Google can make that argument, but epic literally can't release their game on ios unless they use Apple's store.

I think you meant Apple instead of Google there?

I think the argument Apple wants to make is that iOS isn't a gaming platform monopoly. There's consoles, there's PCs, there's android, and they each control a much larger segment of the market. At least in theory.

Now if iOS isn't a monopoly gaming platform, this means that EPIC has choices to not release its game on iOS but still release its game.

*If* (**hypothetically**) we take the above to be true, then this gives a bit more credence to Apple's argument that its actions make it a more attractive platform. After all EPIC, and all the other game companies ""getting screwed by Apple"" could move their games away overnight and make Apple lose all value it has as a gaming platforms. But they stick, because it's not as terrible as EPIC puts it, that is they chose to go into the platform, because they saw it as a good opportunity. They weren't forced, they actually took the effort to get their game running on iOS.

&gt; In fact, apple disallowed stadia on ios saying that every single game most be individually added to the app store and subject to apple handling all payments and using the review system.

Apple is free to consider how their phone should work and what is fine and what isn't. Moreover if Stadia is truly the amazing app that makes people's lives better they'd choose an Android phone. Anti-trust requires that the company's control harm the markets ability to self-regulate. If a company doesn't control the majority of the market, then you can't say its actions are forced.

So in the case of Microsoft it controlled so many of the world's computers, that by controlling the software they ran on these machines, they were able to control the Internet, killing any innovation or improvement that a competitor could cause. Moreover what Microsoft was choosing was to not invest on the internet, and by extension, not allowing anyone else to either. This is why after the anti-trust case you saw a browser renaissance followed by an explosion of web improvements.

Here this won't trigger any change. Apple has a strong position, but they don't quite have that much power on the markets. Apple has dragged its feet on a lot of features and software that first came to Android and then decided to catch up.

Take the keyboard, for example. Android is very open and lets people install different keyboards. The iPhone does not. Because of this Androids have had superior keyboards for a really long time. Even features that I consider critical (such as swipe to type) only came out on iOS 13.

Apple couldn't prevent someone inventing a better keyboard than they had, because there was competition with other phones. If Apple controlled 99% of the phones out there, you could argue that they're stifling the innovation in the field with no justification.

The difference is that in the current scenario Apple couldn't prevent keyboard innovations, and market dynamics made it such that Apple ended up copying features. In the anti-trust scenario no one could ever offer these alternatives because Apple would prevent them.

Similarly if the browsing experience is sub-par on iPhone, people will switch more and more to Android. Unless it happens that it doesn't matter and people don't care about it.

Anti-Trust is not about corporate freedom to do what they want on another platform (for that you want things like FCC's Title II). Anti-Trust is about not doing actions that prevent a fair market.

&gt; They said you could just make it a browser app which was eventually done, but apple gave Amazon a head start.

Apple didn't give them a head start. Amazon was the one that found the loophole. Apple simply validated it. Why didn't Google research this earlier? Maybe because they gave Android priority, and that's their prerogative to. Why didn't Nvidia or others? Maybe they didn't realize they could do this workaround, or didn't have enough experience understanding the rules of iOS. Amazon has apps on it, and doesn't have loyalty to one phone store over another.

&gt; The funny thing is that apple made these the rule changes as stadia and xcloud were about to be released to ios.

As a reaction to. And it's Apple's prerogative to do that. That's not anti-trust. The question is if Apple's actions are preventing the market dynamics.

Apple can make the argument that for people that want streaming games using stadia, they can always buy an Android. Just like someone who wants to play Gears of War can always buy an XBox, and this doesn't give Sony the ability to sue Microsoft for anti-trust. Exclusive media is not anti-trust because it's part of the package you can choose to buy or not. At that point were do we draw the line otherwise? Are menus? OS? The fact that I can't run iOS on my Android phone, does that mean there's an anti-trust case? What about the fact that I can't run Windows? Or DOS?

&gt; Luna unsurprisingly is not available on android yet.

Not surprising at all. Those two companies have always clashed in their stores and protocols. But again not anti-trust.

&gt; Apple is willing to work with Amazon to allow no commission renting of movies because reasons.

That's their prerogative, and what Amazon may be giving them in exchange or not may be different. Again not anti-trust if it doesn't prevent market systems from changing. Android could always offer the killer feature iOS doesn't and take that sweet extra 25% of mobile users.

&gt; Apple is far worse than Microsoft.

Maybe, but the fact that a company does an anti-trust action doesn't mean all their actions are anti-trust.

&gt; Saying people can buy other devices is not a great argument of apple is arguing their store is more like steam than microsoft.

I think that it's not saying ""they can buy elsewhere"" but that ""EPIC is free to sell games on a myriad of platforms that are not the iOS store"" and that's enough to argue that this isn't anti-trust. If this actions result in iOS being an inferior platform for games, then games, and gamers, will move elsewhere.

&gt; Especially when both stores don't even have fortnite.

The argument isn't about fortnite. The argument is that EPIC wants to be able to milk users even more through micro-transactions on their phone systems. It just so happens that fortnite is in the right place strategically to make this argument: it's enough of a game (and not a slot machine with extra steps) that it could bring in sympathy of people (and fans), but fortnite has been losing popularity, so the risk of losing players in iOS (and only iOS) is small enough. But the goal is not fortnite, and it never was about that specific game.

The point is that EPIC has many alternatives they could use. They can pull their games of iOS and, if EPIC is right, it will be Apple's loss.

Or maybe not. Maybe the point is that people get access to a mobile platform, and that's a separate enough experience than you can't use consoles or PCs as alternatives. And you could also argue that, while Apple doesn't control the market of phones, it has a huge defacto influence by everyone targeting both, that if either Apple or Google say something doesn't go, then it just doesn't, independent of what the market would have preferred.

This isn't David vs. Goliath. And there isn't a good or a bad company. Here's two companies, making arguments (non of which are good for the consumers) out of their own greed. It's up to the court to decide if either is right.",1614228886.0,1

 Other than Amazon/Facebook doing obvious spying, retaliation, and anti union actions done by them have been presented with legitimate evidence, this just states someone mentioned it with documents not shown. If it is mentioned or linked anywhere please I’d love to see it.

The company I work for just transition to paying $15ph, and only done so to have good PR after laying off over half of their workforce, doing it again recently. I understand the pr part of it, and I understand the concern.

"My point is $15 is an arbitrary number. Who says that's a ""living wage""? And not every business can afford to pay every employee $15/hr. 

I understand there are many businesses that could pay the employees much more, mostly big giant corporations. Amazon, Walmart, Kroger, and others are the issue. But making the minimum wage an arbitrary number will just hurt small businesses more, while the big companies just automate to offset incurred costs.

$1 raise on average is an additional $2000 of income. Now if you have 3 low level employees making $10/hr, and you raise their pay to $15/hr, that's another $30,000 on payroll, plus all the taxes that come with it. Not every business can handle this. If they do, then prices will simply inflate.

I have a construction company. I am close to my employees. I take care of my employees, which everyone should do, if able. I buy them lunch 5 days a week. I buy them Christmas gifts and birthday gifts. If they need a day or 2 off, or want to go on vacation, I never question them. I want and am able to do this for my employees.

Its just that is the most common form of sub we can get, since so few people are willing to spend money - or have spent it all on the really big names they follow and have none left for the small fry like myself :)

So when I get a sub I am really grateful, but a lot of viewers don't know they have a sub courtesy of Amazon Prime that they can give away each month, so it is worth it to mention it every once in a while.

This month I am making $9.95 from payed subs, $7.49 from Prime subs, $27.74 from gifted subs, $1.00 from a single cheer and a whopping $1.14 from ads. If I am lucky that will be enough to put me over the $100.00 minimum that Twitch has for a payout and I can get my first payout. I have been streaming for almost 2 years now. Twitch is not a way to get rich, its a hobby that might  periodically return some of the  money I have sunk into it so far. Oh and I am apparently within the top 1.35% of streamers to give you an idea of how many people there are out there *not* making any money :)

You are correct that the subs are expiring whenever they come due if they aren't renewed or for multiple months. Twitch also takes half of the revenue from a sub and I believe 80% of the advertising revenue (not that that is much). Most of us, if not all, would prefer to do without the ads.

Amazon workers right now, especially in the warehouses and fulfillment centers, are not happy people. The working conditions are atrocious.  So the rules and such need to get ever more draconian to keep an unhappy workforce productive.  If the conditions improved and morale went up, it would surely be an initial drop in profits (although I think it would be negligible), but over time it would balance out as the workforce became naturally more productive.

At the end of the day, in an ideal world, Amazon would have a happier and more productive workforce, and a much better public image. In the long term this would be better for the share price after an initial drop.",1614328413.0,1

Furthermore, when customers began reporting this to Amazon, the company told them to either keep the products or throw them away.  Just think about that for a second; the sheer wastefulness.

Amazon employees explain that it is common practice for the majority of the items that *are* returned to be thrown away, and that the main reason for sending these unordered items in the first place is to generate 'verified' reviews, keeping only the positive, which are reused, en masse, to make other products look good to potential buyers.

What I don’t think is reasonable is you insinuating that apple is the only manufacturer that does what you’re talking about. Also, while it’s a valid reason for you to not like apple, it doesn’t seem right to spread the gospel of apple hate over your phone breaking and putting you in a bind when any other manufacturers device would’ve likely done the same.

Also, unless I’m mistaken, asurion explicitly tells you you *won’t* get your device back and that should be evident when you receive a device to replace it.

What conversation are we having here? Are you speaking about idealism that encroaches on a discussion of IP law and the foundation of our technology-dependent economy. Take that elsewhere.

I’m aware of the state of shock this puts most people in. I’ve been there - and it’s my job to understand how this stuff works.  However, it’s an imperfect reality that actually has some benefits in an imperfect world. Helping others come to this realization is what I’m here getting downvoted and insulted for.

This isn’t 1950. The world has changed. The value we place on time, life, and stability - and our reliance on technology is drastically different. In addition we must recognize the competitiveness of a still-burgeoning global marketplace, mind-bendingly complex supply chains, and an onslaught of competition that does not respect local IP or safety regulations - companies and consumers both have a lot to be concerned about.

The recording and surveillance  of every phone call and textual conversation we have is also not a listed feature - and where are the R2R politicians on that topic?

No one's forcing you to sideload apps or stores that you're not comfortable with, no one would hold a gun to your head urging you to replace your own phone battery with one that you bought off of Amazon.

Forcing manufacturers to create open ecosystems invites bad actors - this is problematic for company reputations and for consumer confidence.  Also, complying with increased design and sustaining regulations increases start-up and day-to-day costs for new competition - this limits consumer choice in the end to those who are in bed with regulators and those who can afford sustaining costs that R2R activists are too ignorant to tabulate because they only see supply chain from one side. Do you understand that the other side has to look into the future and figure out how to facilitate an indeterminate amount of OEM replacement parts for the unknown number of units that will fail for however long a consumer wants to use their device? Do you understand how expensive it is to even continue to qualify OEM-grade parts 5 years later?

"Why isn't there public hubub about taxing just the shipping industries, or putting sanctions on countries that break emissions goals instead of forcing all this on the taxpayer? Keep in mind that when gasoline is taxed the high hell at the pump (not by corporations) and when the sale of gasoline personal transport is banned, how will poor people fair? The people who depend on vehicles in north america due to its disgusting public transportation to get back and forth from their workplaces? They just have to go out and buy a 40,000 dollar EV? Yeah, middle america will fair just fine when they go buy their next car after only 3-4 years, they'll just buy an EV and install the charger in their garage. The poor, on the other hand, will no longer be able to afford gas to get to their work, and will be forced to sell their now worthless car since they cannot afford gas anymore. What will they do? You can't expect the government to help out all of these poor people with subsidies, not only will the government just forget about them anyway, but it would be insanely expensive to buy these people cars. These people will have to take 3-5 hour transit trips to and from work with lots of walking, or be forced to quit their jobs. While the multi billion dollar corporations just keep dumping carbon into the atmosphere because people LOVE to order from Amazon.

""Don't tax only the corporations, then they'll make things cost more to compensate!"" So don't bug the rich or else the rich will bite back? That's pretty messed up. I don't mind paying an extra 10 bucks for shipping if it means that the carbon tax is 50% cheaper at the pumps for our citizens to still use to get to and from work until EVs begin to have cheap options and there's supply in the used markets for people who need but can't afford.

I can't wait for the day that gasoline becomes so expensive it causes an unemployment shortage.

So if the arbitrator decides Amazon is ""doing something shitty"" they rule in favor of the plaintiff, Amazon pays and that's it. Amazon is free to continue ""doing something shitty"". 

If it goes to court and a judge decides Amazon is ""doing something shitty"" they find in favor of the plaintiff and order Amazon to stop ""doing something shitty"". This becomes a legal precedent, and if Amazon continues to do said shitty thing, the next person to sue can bring forward this ruling and say that Amazon needs to show how this is a totally new and different shitty thing. If Amazon fails at this they risk a judge deciding that since Amazon was previously told to stop ""doing something shitty"" and did not, Amazon now needs an even bigger smack on the pee-pee.

You get templated responses almost every single time, the international support team who handles probably 60% or more of the tickets almost never actually looks into the issues and just tried to close the ticket as fast as possible with the smallest impact to amazon, and any time they deny you requests they absolutely never tell you why, they just give you a templated response that never specified what your request did not have in it to get approved. Almost always it takes 2-4 times to submit a ticket to actually get things resolved, sometimes I have to call or they won't figure it out, and many times I submit the same ticket with the same data over and over again until it's approved because like I said, they just deny it for BS reasons and don't tell you what's wrong with it (even if you did actually met all the set criteria). It's the absolute worst part of selling on amazon. Instead of work for hours and hours and hours and hours to try and get them to do what they should do, I usually just take the financial hit because taking a few thousand dollars as a hit is much better than spending hundreds of hours a year trying to deal with their support team.",1614800661.0,1

Basic cable costs about $65 a month in the US(this number can varry widely by exact package, and location in the country).
https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-the-average-cost-of-cable-tv-per-month

This would be an equivalent price point, but not a comparable product. Streaming allows you control of when you want to watch something, and most of these streaming services don't contain ads. This price equivalent streaming option gives you amazon prime. You can also watch these services on multiple different devices and in different locations. All points in favor of streaming over cable.

There is an argument to be made that wifi or internet of some kind is required to use these streaming services(which costs about $50 a month, also subject to exact products purchased and where one lives[https://www.allconnect.com/blog/cost-of-high-speed-internet]), but that only seems valid if you are going to stop having an internet connection if you get rid of your streaming services. 
Further, this cost goes down if you have other individuals willing to go in on some kind of group rate and split the cost to stream, similar to having those you live with split your utilitybills, like internet.

By no means am I claiming this is an inexpensive good to purchase, there are plenty of flaws in streaming services, and it's strange to me that I miss the monopoly Netflix had, but to claim the cable is anything other than a more expensive, inferior product at this time seems difficult to defend, with the exception of people like my Grandparents, who are unable, unwilling, or uninterested in learning to use streaming services over cable at this late point in their life.

"Hey 👋 work in the industry. Let's break this down... the cookie-pocolypse has been a thing the industry has been inching towards for nearly the better part of the last decade. Why?

Cookies are notoriously inaccurate. The real data goldmine is tangible data like Mastercard data or your Amazon purchasing behavior. 

Let's take Amazon for a second...they can tie purchase behavior like do you use a credit card, how often, how much do you spend, when do you spend back to a user ID. 

These audience segments are much more valuable when working w a client and are used quite often for targeting. 

So you kind of hit it on the head - cookies are going away because they have better solutions.

This also means that the data management platforms and the many, many players within the space will be drastically reduced. That isn't necessarily a bad or good thing. There are a bulk of ""bad actors"" in the space that will go away because their business is based solely in cookies.

They would not know average price you spend on your credit card for example.

Or that you've recently added and abandoned in cart a Samsung tv with an average sales price of $X. 

Your ISPS is tied to behavior on a device being used. Let's say the devices are in a household of 5. The results are tethered to that.

Now expand that to a lets say a corporate building in NYC with several floors and thousands of employees. 

This is why for example Polk data is so important to car companies. It isnt tethered to someone browsing about new cars (which they could or could not be in-market for). Polk data is tied to people, not machines.

You can see this in Safeway, Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, Amazon, or any mega-store.  Decades of consumer behavior says it's not going to change, so the divide between the not-rich and the rich accelerates because the not-rich are encouraged to destroy their own markets while the rich simply avoid the ""little people"" stores and buy from exclusive luxury brands who wouldn't be caught dead on Amazon or in Walmart.

If amazon were smart (I would argue that they are), they would drag this out for months until the current unemployment benefit policy ends, and when that does eventually happen, stop scheduling everyone that wanted to unionize (effectively firing them without actually doing just that) and hire every person desperate for a job because they need the money as a replacement.

The point is that her building is located right next to the local food bank and it even says that she will train any potential hires. There are too many people unemployed at this time and collecting unemployment. All amazon has to do is wait until the wage they are offering is higher than the unemployment benefit and people will start going back to work just to make ends meet.

As far as revenue, is amazon willing to pay to train 6000 workers for a week to avoid dealing with a long term union contract? I would guess that would be a yes. They have been very transparent in their position on unionization. I would also be willing to wager a fair number of folks would stick around without a union due to their need for a paycheck every other week. I am not advocating against a union, but I don't think amazon is maybe the best place for it. They would have too much power for their own good. Look at the steel unions from Detroit and the end result of unions having too much authority.

" AWS provided $3.54 billion in operating profit in the third quarter on revenue of $11.6 billion, while Amazon’s domestic e-commerce business contributed $2.25 billion and the overseas business produced $407 million, its second consecutive operating profit after years of losses. Amazon reported “Other” revenue, which is mostly ad-related, of $5.4 billion.


This totals roughly 11bn in operating profit. 3.54 of which is AWS. Other quarters last year were similar.

"&gt; Their network is designed to work around sites going down.

Their entire business model is designed around 'almost good enough' and 'things fail, deal with it'.

Their AWS cloud platform is deigned for you to run in multiple regions so that an entire region can fail and your system/customer's won't notice.  This is in part because, even within a single region when things are working correctly, things still fail for no reason so you have to build redundancies and retries as part of the day-to-day workload.  All that matters is that AWS can spin up new instances faster than the existing ones are failing.

Their Amazon Fresh (grocery) delivery model includes an automated process for you to indicate that the food that was delivered to you was bad, and for you to get a refund without dealing with a human.  They've gotten cheap/lazy with their packaging and (at least around here) their frozen foods are underpackaged.  Every single grocery order I have received in the past year has had temperature problems with at least some of the frozen foods.  Without fail, I order the same ~$15 worth of frozen groceries, they show up thawed, I file a complaint, and get an immediate refund for those items.  The only time I had to deal with a human was when one bag was insulated and the other wasn't; I had a partial return and that must have flagged something.  Every single time I've had a full return (or at least return all of that item) I've been able to do it through their automated system and gotten an ""immediate"" refund (immediate answer/promise of the refund, and then the refund/credit is in my account within the next 12-24 hours).

All they really need to keep operating is one facility in a region to ship out the 2-day shipments, and even if they lose that they've thrown out the 2-day shipping guarantee in the past for 'reasons', so everything could be handled from a different region.

You've got to hit them hard, across the board, and for a long time for them to suffer.",1614884882.0,-1

"This article is absolute junk. 

Management shouldn't have the right to explain the downsides of a union? You can be sure the union spent months pitching all the upsides. At the end of the day though it's a secret ballot so your boss isn't going to pressure you to vote anyway.

There are legitimate reasons to fight over who should be in the unit. But even to the extent that there is gaming going on, it is going on on both sides as the union gets to propose what workers are in it at the beginning and you can be sure they drew the proposed unit with the same electioneering in mind.

Oh yeah and it's not Amazon deciding who is in the proposed union, it is the National Labor Review Board. Amazon just makes its argument that certain workers are not eligible to be in the union and the NLRB, not Amazon, decides.

Delays are not a big deal because the election process actually happens super fast which I know from personal experience. If they insist on a hearing about the proper union membership then that only delays the election by a couple of weeks which isn't a big deal. Observe that the article doesn't say how long the delay is but just acts like any delay whatsoever is horrible.

I could keep going on but let me end with this point. What Amazon is doing to oppose the union is not illegal. And if it was, then the union could file an unlawful labor practice charge against Amazon. If the violation is serious then Amazon can be forced to recognize a union even if it loses the election. So you can be sure that Amazon is not doing anything that is even arguably illegal and serious.

A 1% revenue fine is nearly a 50% decrease in the amount of money the grocery store has to spend on salaries, rent, electricity, etc, etc.  You can ditto this for any highly elastic consumer good.

Meanwhile Google's or Amazon's margins are high enough to eat that without a problem.  20% margins would be surprisingly low to me for their digital sectors (i.e. not including Amazon's store).

&gt;	U.S. employers are charged with violating federal law in 41.5% of all union election campaigns. 

&gt;	Beyond this, there are many things employers can do legally to thwart union organizing; employers spend roughly $340 million annually on “union avoidance” consultants to help them stave off union elections. This combination of illegal conduct and legal coercion has ensured that union elections are characterized by employer intimidation and in no way reflect the democratic process guaranteed by the National Labor Relations Act.

&gt;	Far more U.S. workers want unions than have the benefit of representation today. 

&gt;	On average, a worker covered by a union contract earns 13.2% more than a peer with similar education, occupation, and experience in a nonunionized workplace in the same sector. Union workers are more likely to have employer-sponsored health insurance, and their employers contribute more toward those plans. They are also more likely to have paid vacation and sick leave. Union workers are more likely to have retirement plans, with their employers contributing more toward those plans than comparable nonunion employers do. Unions also create safer workplaces. And union workers are covered by due process protections, so that, unlike nonunion workers in the U.S., union workers cannot be fired “at will,” with no warning and for almost any reason.

Amazon is deeply important right now, as they are facing a potentially historic unionization vote, however it needs to be constantly said that Amazon *is not unique* in the practices it uses against labor and is emblematic of a much larger effort against unions.

The unionization rate in the US has fallen (or, really, has been reduced by concerted efforts) from around 30-35% in 1970 to ~10% today, while inequality and wage stagnation have taken off.

[Unions in the US provide their members many benefits, such as higher pay, paid sick leave, paid vacation, better healthcare, etc.](https://preview.redd.it/i1i97e95u8l61.png?auto=webp&amp;s=60c91d1bb8fa94e2675b15c056a07c9debde86dc)

&gt;	According to the American Management Association, nearly 80% of major US companies actively spy on their employees.

&gt;	During the first week of February 2011, the Internet hacker cooperative Anonymous released e-mails which appear to show that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, through their law firm, Hunton &amp; Williams, contracted with three technology firms, including HBGary, Palantir Technologies, and Berico Technologies, to spy on and discredit unions and political opponents.[89][90] Palantir received startup funds from the CIA in 2005.[91] Release of the emails appears to have caused the parties to abort the attacks.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_spying_in_the_United_States

The US Chamber of Commerce - which hired firms like Palantir to spy and discredit unions - is the largest lobbying organization in the US, and has spent over $1.5 billion in lobbying since 2000. It is a lobbying arm for many of the biggest companies in the US, such as Citi, Coca-Cola, Facebook, GE, Pfizer, Google, Target, Uber, etc, and has also funded large amounts of climate change denialism and inaction.

If you work for a large corporation in the US, it is *very* likely the company is spying on you and keeping an eye on any potential labor movements: https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/11/09/how-big-corporations-spy-their-workers-keep-their-wages-down

I’d highly recommend this book, which is a collection of essays dealing with the myths around unions in the US (as well as the issues present in US unions):

&gt;	From Wisconsin to Washington, DC, the claims are made: unions are responsible for budget deficits, and their members are overpaid and enjoy cushy benefits. The only way to save the American economy, pundits claim, is to weaken the labor movement, strip workers of collective bargaining rights, and champion private industry. In “They’re Bankrupting Us!”: And 20 Other Myths about Unions, labor leader Bill Fletcher Jr. makes sense of this debate as he unpacks the twenty-one myths most often cited by anti-union propagandists. Drawing on his experiences as a longtime labor activist and organizer, Fletcher traces the historical roots of these myths and provides an honest assessment of the missteps of the labor movement. He reveals many of labor’s significant contributions, such as establishing the forty-hour work week and minimum wage, guaranteeing safe workplaces, and fighting for equity within the workforce. This timely, accessible, “warts and all” book argues, ultimately, that unions are necessary for democracy and ensure economic and social justice for all people.

"&gt; If a grocer does enough damage to have the related fines bankrupt the company, the company probably deserves bankruptcy.

The point is that the bar for ""bad enough to bankrupt the company"" is going to be a lot lower for someone like Amazon than it is for a grocer.  We can use GDPR as a proxy here.  Amazon and a grocery store are both found guilty of mishandling user data.  Something about their rewards program was bad.  Are you going to fine the grocery store 0.5% of it's revenue, and like 10% of Amazon's revenue?  Those numbers equate to a roughly equal decrease in operating income, assuming a 40% margin for Amazon.

It's also worth noting that you're going to end up fining Amazon for revenue that was entirely unrelated to the issue at hand.  The union issues have literally nothing to do with AWS.  There is no push for a union among AWS, as far as I know.  Nobody in AWS is affected by the conditions in warehouses.

The other side, which is often ignored, is that the US benefits from the effective monopoly big tech has.  Like, a lot.  FANG + Microsoft is 10% of the value in the S&amp;P 500.  A huge portion of our economic productivity comes from them.  If you want to fine Amazon enough that it hurts, get ready to feel that pain, because we'll all suffer.  Hopefully they'd course correct and stop doing whatever it is they were fined for, but in the mean time, it's going to hurt investor confidence.  Amazon shares will tank, and they're large enough to cause full percentage point swings in the S&amp;P 500.  It will likely hurt confidence in other big tech as well, which will add to the dip.  I get that fucking over the big investors is fine, but there are a lot of 401ks invested in index funds.  The prevailing advice for normal people looking to invest is to invest in an index fund.  This is going to hurt those, immensely.  Like, ""it's going to take a couple years to get back to where you were"" kind of hurt.

Those fines are also likely to come out of the R&amp;D budget.  Profitability is low, I don't think they do dividends, they dump pretty much everything into R&amp;D.  In an isolationist economy, that's basically fine.  We only compete internally, another competitor will take it over.  In a global environment, making our companies less competitive comes with a very real chance that a huge part of our GDP ends up going to some other country (likely China, given their rapidly advancing tech sector).

If a grocer by some unbelievable twist of fate manages to do an amount of damage that is comparable to the damage done by Amazon while breaking the law, then they should be fined a comparable amount.  The fines levied should be commiserate with the *damage caused*, and CAPPED by the revenue the company receives.  Thus a judge will determine what the exact value of the fine is, but has the capacity to levy much larger fines (if the damage is sufficient enough) against companies that have deeper pockets.

&gt;The other side, which is often ignored, is that the US benefits from the effective monopoly big tech has. Like, a lot. FANG + Microsoft is 10% of the value in the S&amp;P 500. A huge portion of our economic productivity comes from them. If you want to fine Amazon enough that it hurts, get ready to feel that pain, because we'll all suffer.

This is some jank libertarian logic right here.  I am not willing to turn a blind eye to damages caused by large corporations simply because they may benefit me slightly.  This isn't a ""greater good"" equation here.  Companies need to be held accountable *proportionate to the damage they cause*, and if needed with some added punitive fines to dissuade other companies from following that same route.

Online retailer websites literally can't process thousands of transactions within milliseconds. Maybe through some direct API but even Amazon doesn't serve webpages that fast. They're not designed for that. So I doubt bots somehow managed to secure a datacenter worth of cards for each miner.

The only plausible explanation is that AMD, Nvidia, their distributors and retailers sold their stock to miners in backroom deals without ever letting the majority of the stock even come on the market. They of course all immediately turn around and make half assed efforts to show how they're trying to 'help' the situation but in fact they're just throwing their customers under the bus and treating the neglected customers like they're idiots.

"Why are you talking about Amazon when the article is about Apple? 

Between Apple and Google you've got damn near 100% of all phones. Hence the bit about phone companies cutting undesirables from phone service.

Why stop here? Why not ban people they don't like from apple Id/google account? 

Can you even use a phone without those?

But why stop there? Maybe at&amp;t can decide privately to end your cell service? And all the others can make the same decision after they see the article?  You know what? Maybe visa and mastercard decide to too. And literally all the ""life infrastructure"" companies can decide privately that they don't want to serve you? 

And why stop with people you believe you disagree with politically? Just monitor social media, and when someone makes a bad remark, privately decide to not do business with them. Ex cons? Easy prey.

"I feel like this article is a little misguided as NFTs are revolutionary as they help solve the problem of digital ownership. 

Literally imagine any digital asset that you purchase through an online service. For example, when you buy a game on Steam you do not own the game, Steam simply grants access to this digital resource. Similar systems exist for books or movies on Amazon or skins in League of Legends. With the point being that you don’t own these goods. You cannot resell these goods to someone else like you would be able to if you had purchased the good physically. 

NFTs help track the ownership of digital goods and prevent duplication through consensus on the blockchain. This allows people to carry there digital goods with them across platforms or sell those goods to other people. The implementations of this are as boundless as the ownership of goods in real life. 

An example application in the short term, you could create an entirely NTF back Magic the Gather like card game. Card tokens could be minted and sold on various markets to players just like real cards. These cards could then be used on any platform that could link to your Ethereum wallet to determine which cards you had access too and players would be able to independently sell and trade cards with each other. 

A more grounded application of NFTs are to use them to create digital versions of legal documents such as a deed to a house or a title to a car as they could be used to create a public chain of ownership that cannot be easily lost, doctored, or destroyed. 

A more futuristic look at NFTs could come with later advancements in virtual reality technology. If we get to a point where we have Ready Player One or Sword Art Online esk digital environment, personal ownership could become a problem as you wouldn’t want people finding some kind of item duplication glitch and ruining your in game economy. NFTs could be used to keep track of what items a player owned and it could allow them to bring items to different virtual worlds (assuming that those assets were supported). If this sounds to farfetched several companies are already getting in on the digital real estate space [Digital Real-estate boom article ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.coindesk.com/here-comes-the-virtual-real-estate-boom%3Famp%3D1) and that land is already worth millions of dollars, so I wouldn’t be surprised if those worlds later became the foundation for more fanatical worlds in the future. Further building on this idea, in the coming years there is no reasons that all of those art NFTs that have been purchased couldn’t be placed in those digital spaces to be shown off. Basically imagine VRchat on steroids. 

Also on the topic of emissions, NFTs do consume a lot of electricity due to the proof of work model. This will be fixed on the Ethereum network with the the switch to the proof of stake model in the full launch of Ethereum 2.0 some where between 2021-2025 [more details here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/cointelegraph.com/news/when-will-ethereum-2-0-fully-launch-roadmap-promises-speed-but-history-says-otherwise/amp). Proof of stake should reduce energy consumption by 99% [more details here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/ethereum-plans-to-cut-its-absurd-energy-consumption-by-99-percent.amp.html). Also since Ethereum is open source it is very likely that other coins will adopt of proof of stake model once it is fully released, not to mention all of ECR20 complaint coins that already run on the Ethereum network. Also for reference, around 74% of Bitcoin nodes relay of renewable energy as miners want to keep their operating costs as low as possible [source](https://www.ledger.com/energy-consumption-crypto-vs-fiat) this is likely similar for other crypto networks as the same people who mine bitcoin tend to act as nodes for other networks. Lastly from my understanding, although it gets a lot of media attention crypto mining is not nearly as harmful for the environment as other far more damaging industries such as the [livestock](https://www.google.com/amp/s/insideclimatenews.org/news/21102019/climate-change-meat-beef-dairy-methane-emissions-california/%3Famp) or [cruise ship](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL32450.html#_Toc280627472) industries for example.

Lastly I will say something that I feel gets left out of the crypto discourse a lot is that one of the main value propositions cryptocurrency and by extension NFTs is that it comes really close to completely solving the [double spending problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending?wprov=sfti1) which is super valuable on its own.

" There are three reasons. 



This increased capital gains tax will not hit the super rich at all, and only hit your small business owners and entrepreneurs selling their companies. Bezos could just borrow money against his shares and never pay it back. As long as he doesn't borrow too much, and Amazon doesnt lose too much value the, the bank will happily keep racking up interest on loans. Bezos for example could never sell a share. 



Capital gains are also lower because investing into capital equipment and buildings is what drives wealth. What allows Americans to prosper more, manufacturing equipment that lowers the cost to produce goods or a new car? If we don't emphasize investing, then we become less competitive and it makes sense our Tax code would be the same way. 



Finally, its about risk.  That business owner may not get paid for the first year. He may be mortgaging his house to keep it afloat. Its rare that a business is profitable in the first few years.

&gt;A company should not be ""yours"" the same way the phone in your pocket is yours because you bought it.

That's why Amazon is a publicly traded entity. In exchange for Amazon not being Bezos's anymore, the exchange is he gets shares and Amazon gets publicly listed.

"Amazon actually wants to raise the minimum wage. It’s kind of counterintuitive at first, but raising the minimum has a high chance to increase his personal pool of wealth. 

In many markets the increase could easily put many mom &amp; pop and other small business owners out of business. If a retailer is having to pay workers less just to stay afloat because they do not get the big bulk savings that Amazon would, they would logically have to increase prices. Many consumers won’t pay the extra price; thus, the business will likely fail leading to increased dependence on Amazon.

"&gt;Avoiding stereotypes, Joe Schmoe should also be able to have and support a family. Maybe with his wife, but wait, she also works in an Amazon warehouse. So now we have 2 Amazon drones supporting 1 child. Someone do the math and tell me how feasible that isn’t. Assuming that they need to:

&gt; 1) Rent 2) At least 2 bedrooms 3) At least 2 baths 4) No childcare since both parents are working full time 5) Based on the AVERAGE cost of living in the US

Playing devils advocate... A one-bathroom apartment is... totally fine for 3 people. Why at least two baths? I spent most of my childhood in a one-bedroom apartment and my mom used the 'living room' as a second bedroom. It was fine. I went to school and had after-school programs so my mom could work from 8-7pm.

Working as a warehouse 'drone' (your word) isn't a professional or skilled career. Rather than artificially inflating wages for 'drone' jobs that will soon be automated... tax appropriately and pay for the services people need (childcare, education, healthcare). Allow people the freedom to retrain in skilled, in-demand jobs. 

The question is to what extent do we as a society want to tax companies that succeed at capitalism and redistribute it to redundant/replaceable people. There's an urgency to have this debate, for the sake of social stability.

Amazon actually follows an old school corporate model, similar to heyday americorps in their expansion and long term approach, when more companies were controlled by a single family and cared less about monthly figures.

"That’s a self fulfilling prophecy through.  Any union that is too inefficient or in a too highly competitive industry dies.  The unions that exist do so because they benefit the workers more than they cost.  

But we’re not talking about a union that does exist.  We are talking about ones which do not.    There are countless unions that could exist but don’t because it doesn’t make sense.  Software developers don’t unionize because they have extreme lock-in ability.  Electrical engineers don’t unionize because the market gives them significant bargaining power alone.  Google workers don’t unionize because the company voluntarily pays well above market rates.  A union in these fields would not be able to give enough additional bargaining power to close the difference between market rate and value add (the ZOPA) AND cover the dues.

Demanding a union for Amazon seems kinda pointless IMO.  Amazon pays well above market rates so the recoverable ZOPA is very small.  That and the union would be highly fractured due to the sheer size of the company leading to mixed results.  It may also hurt employees overall since people in Bend will be making rules for people in Portland (and vice versa).

  I don’t work for Amazon so I can’t speak to working conditions, but from a financial position it seems dumb.  You’ll be paying a lot of money for extra rules and the potential upside seems very small.  If conditions themselves are shit, sure make a union and fix it.

I think you're being melodramatic. They don't have to die. I have a transient who hangs around my store (I work at a gas station), he's been on the street for 27 years. He eats 3 meals a day, smokes a pack, drinks a pint of whisky, a gallon of soda, and hasn't worked a day, in 27 years. This isn't a matter of survival.

The employer has all the power when they're the ones controlling the money, the man waiting in line for a job to feed his family is virtually powerless. Replaced in a second, and you expect them to just fend for themselves among the wolves with no resources

They didn't and don't have to work for him. He doesn't have any power they don't give him. They could come work for my company.

I can drive a BMW, take nice vacations, wear a fucking Rolex (have you seen the 'white grape' 36 and 39mm Oyster Perpetual? Wew, shits pretty cool). Shit, they could get into dispersed camping and live off the land, start their own business...

Like, these people voluntarily entered into a contract -  they aren't slaves. If the terms of the said contract weren't to their liking, they could go somewhere else.  

And, who would you blame? If there were no billionaires, who would you rail at for your shitty lot in life? Would lay down and die? Give up? If Bezos hadn't created those jobs, what would you do?

What responsibility? It seems obvious to me that no one has any responsibility to help others. In fact, no one has any responsibility to others at all, except to respect their rights, and those created by contract.

Amazon hires people, and pays them the wages and benefits that they’ve agreed to work for. It sells you things at the price that you’ve agreed to pay for. It’s all voluntary; there’s no coercion involved, and the only responsibility of Amazon is to fulfill its contractual obligations.

&gt;If we continually allow wealth and corporates to rule this world, lacking in overall decency and inclusion with those around us whom suffer from the large growth and depletion of resources at ever decreasing costs, there is no future for this planet.

Morally irrelevant. Just because “bad things will happen if you don’t do X” doesn’t mean anyone is morally obligated to do X - and I beg to differ that “there is no future for this planet”. Capitalism has brought wealth and prosperity to humanity the likes of which we have never seen before.

What the fuck is “overall decency and inclusion” anyways? That’s not a moral standard, that’s a cop-out, because you can define “decency” however you want to.

&gt; From the start, Google and Wikipedia have been in a kind of unspoken partnership: Wikipedia produces the information Google serves up in response to user queries, and Google builds up Wikipedia&amp;#039;s reputation as a source of trustworthy information.

&gt; Now Wikipedia is seeking to rebalance its relationships with Google and other big tech firms like Amazon, Facebook, and Apple, whose platforms and virtual assistants lean on Wikipedia as a cost-free virtual crib sheet.

&gt; For Wikipedia to reject this steady stream of money, to throw up objections based on principle, would perhaps seem as quixotic and stubborn as those homeowners who turn down a big check from a real estate developer planning a new skyscraper.

"Ladies and gentlemen: privacy.com

It gives you so much power over your subscriptions, plus it adds a layer of security.

Instead of giving your debit information to a dozen different sites, you give your debit information to one. Then you use that site to generate debit cards; single-use cards that disappear after they are charged or multi-use cards with a maximum monthly spending limit.

If you get ahold of my Amazon account, you wouldn't be able to spend more than about a hundred dollars on it before the card I have on file gets declined.

With subscription services, I set up cards with a monthly limit of one dollar higher than the monthly fee. If they ever raise the price like mad, they won't be able to charge me. If I decide I don't want their service any more or if I just don't want their service this month, I can go in and delete or temporarily pause any card I wish.

You know all those ""The first month is free! Then it's only $99 million after that!"" deals? Simply create a card with a monthly spending limit of $1. You get your free month and if you forget to unsubscribe no worries you won't be charged. If you decide you want to keep the service, simply increase the limit to meet the monthly fee.

It gives you so much power and security.

I'm not a shill, I just *adore* the power this free service gives me and want to spread it to others. Fuck corporations that abuse us. Take your power back.",1615955925.0,1

"Don't ever pay for anything online that requires you to pay monthly by credit/debit/bank account. Use counter checks, cash, MoneyGram or money order (I know checks and money orders are not always considered reliable).

I had a very terrible experience with banking fraud. It was difficult to untangle but now I have practices around the way I use my plastic and monthly expenses that probably only partly prevent problems. These are the things I now avoid:

* Cable TV. No, don't need it. Besides the price always changes to an increased amount.
* Internet. I pay for it in person with cash. 
* When using messaging apps or email I never talk or text about banking matters. 
* Car insurance/car payment. Nope. Now it's carpool, public transportation, rideshare, taxi walk or ride a bike. Any way I can think of to avoid using my card
* Internet subscriptions? No way. No Amazon purchases, no Hulu or Netflix, no gaming. I can find other ways to entertain myself. 
* Gym membership. No, I'm going outside to walk, bike, hike or if the weather is nasty I'm doing indoor workouts (dance party!).
* Even the IRS. Nope. They accept money orders and checks if I owe them. They can send me a check, they don't need my bank account information.
* Buying anything in a store, I'm using cash. No swipe or chip for me.
* ATM. No, I now walk into the bank
* Food delivery. No, cooking at home

This is only a short list and I know exactly how intense it sounds. Think very carefully about the difference between what you need vs what you only want, especially online. It can be tempting to buy something online out of convenience especially due to COVID.

The result of me putting my bank account information in the wrong place at the wrong time had horrifying results and took more than a year to resolve and as you can see I am still looking over my shoulder.

Also any ""delete account"" options pushing you HARD to just ""deactivate"" your account, to the point where they make you believe that you can't actually delete it at all and that that's your best option, should be illegal too.

"I really don't know if anyone will see this, but.....

In October of 2019, I applied at Amazon to become a package delivery driver. You know, the people who drive those Amazon vans around. Anyways....I am not entirely sure how to describe it but after I made it thru the first few steps of the hiring process, I was given a start date that was tenative pending drug test screen results. During this time, I started to freak out and had an anxiety attack over the thought of working at Amazon and my fears seemed irrational to me at the time. I had a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach that was telling me that if I continued on the path of trying work for them, that something is going to go wrong and something bad might happen to me. My fiance wanted me to give it try for a bit and I reluctantly agreed.

The following week I had not heard anything back about my drug screen results. I smoke cannabis and I had smoked a little too close to the day I had my mouth swab done. But I thought I was in the clear. Fate intervened and took a weight off my shoulders, because I failed my drug test screening and I had never been so happy to fail a drug test in my entire life lol. And I was still kicking myself at the same time for being so irrational.

Here's the plot twist of this story: I had no real need to get back to work right away and I was able to do what I want. So I decided not go back into the work force. And then the COVID-19 PANDEMIC hit and Amazon employees started getting sick and started dying. And now here are the Amazon employees demanding fair treatment &amp; wages. That whole thing is has been a disaster for them. I can't say enough how relieved I am that fate saw its way to prevent me from working for a large corporation that has proven that they do not care about their employees.

Ted Cruz argues that privatization is a good thing, while people are scrambling for warmth and food, while he is on vacation, presumably in a comfortable climate controlled room. He is not facing any of the consequences of privatization as he advocates for it. Therefore, that is an example of bad grandstanding.

Now let's see at the actual data:

I am sure there are more white at the Amazon warehouses because the smaller companies often employ undocumented immigrants at these types of jobs who have much lower pay, no benefits, no vacation benefit, no education benefits, etc. You have over 15 million people who basically replaced many regular, blue collar Americans at so many simple jobs like this one. So no wonder there are huge lines of people desperate to get a job at Amazon warehouses when they open up - because they do start at 15-16/hr, give benefits, vacation, education, etc. This is virtually unheard of at smaller companies, partially because of the massive illegal immigration from Latin America over the past 15+ years. What party is trying to legalize those who come here illegally, including those crossing the border right now? The last immigration proposal from the Biden Admin is offering just that. No wonder so many regular, hard working Americans turned to the Republican party, including in the Midwest, where millions shifted from Obama in 2008 and 2012 to Trump in 2016 and 2020.",1616879482.0,-1

So the losses are socialized retroactively? Does this play some part in how Amazon has become so massive?,1616928119.0,1
"No. The gist is that the governement says if you spend a ton of money this year to grow your company, we'll let you write it off next year. So let's say Amazon makes $1B a year profit but decides to build a $10B warehouse so they can make $2B.  The year they build it, they're negative $9B. They can carry that negative $9B forward and the next year be negative $7B. Carry the $7B forward and so on. 

The governement does this to incentivize risk taking and growth because our model prefers to collect taxes at the local level from payroll and property rather then corporate taxes. No company should be paying corporate taxes in the US - if you own a company and you end the year up $100k, you can either pocket the money and pay income tax, leave it in the company and pay corporate tax, or hire a new engineer or what ever to try to make more profit next year. Companies almost always choose the second and third option which leads to no corporate tax being paid.",1616931016.0,-1

Instead, they harvested a shitload of losses so that when they did finally have to slow down, they could defer taxes as long as possible.

There is nothing shady about any of that though. Those losses resulted in a shitload of jobs for the american people and a boom to the american economy. They should be rewarded for what they have done for the country and they are cashing in on that reward.

You know that stocks aren't just a ticker symbol that goes up and down, right? Behind every stock there is a real, actual company, with real actual assets and incomes and expenses.

Every time Amazon loses money, that money comes out of the assets that amazon shareholders have. Amazon shareholders put up millions in the 90s, and for 20 years amazon whittled them away by losing money, until finally they were in a position where they could begin earning some.

Imagine you're a one man company, you chop wood and sell it. 

Now, you need some startup capital for that, after all you can't very well chop wood with your hands, and you might need some cash to handle expenses and pay salaries (you're an employee after all, and you need to pay yourself at least minimum wage!). So you do the math, and you put in 150$ in this one man company. 

You use 100$ to buy an axe, which you use to chop the wood and sell. You make 105$ throughout the year, and pay yourself the minimum wage of 100$ a year. Sounds good right? You made yourself a clean 5$! 

But wait, that Axe you bought isn't going to last forever, at the rate you're going, in 5 years it will be broken and useless and you'll have to buy another! So you have to depreciate that axe, so that 5 years from now you can replace it. So depreciation is 100$ / 5 Years = 20$ a year. 

So you didn't actually made a profit, you made a 15$ loss!

Depreciation is a real actual thing, if you don't account for it, then in 5 years you'll have 25$ and no Axe, so the 100$ you put in initially turned into 25$!",1616953660.0,-1

Non-profits have nothing to do with their profitability... And they do and can go bankrupt.

I had a contractor job with google for a few years as a ""Google sales manager"" which basically meant I hung out in a best buy as their on site google expert, which basically just meant I was the in store specialist for all things google. At some point, both Amazon and google dropped a bunch of money on fancy new displays in the ""connected home"" department, to show off their smart speakers and other products, only amazon wasn't paying extra to have extra to have their own reps in stores, which meant googles specialists where more or less free to poach potential alexa customers with no competition. 

At some point, amazon became aware of this, and made a big stink to best buy about it, who made a big stink to out company telling us to stay away from our displays. So we spent a month or so getting yelled at about it in meetings, but not much changed, because at the end of the day, we had to be over there to do out jobs, and best buy in store management gave zero shits, if they even hear about it at all. 

One day, a few months after all of this goes down, I'm hanging out at the display having a spirited conversation with a guy about general tech an IoT things, not trying to sell anything but just kinda vibing and geeking out together. This store was close to a bunch of tech firms and one of the best known tech schools in the US, so it wasn't unusual for this to happen.

At some point in the conversation, I look to my left, and notice this guy eyeballing me, I feel like I vaguely recognize him, throw him a nod, he maintains eye contact for a few moments and storms out the store. I go back to the conversation, and a minute or less later, Jeffs name comes back, and comes rushing back to me, holy shit. 

That was Jeff fucking Bezos.

I hopped my phone real quick and it turns out that he was in fact in the city that day scouting HQ2 locations, then hopped in a work group chat, and it turns out a buddy in another store saw him too. 

I actually ended up losing my shit a little bit thinking I was going to lose my job, and it didn't help that one of the assistant managers was a practical joker who after hearing about it decided to tell me he got a call saying there had been a complaint about me.

"Granting labor unions monopolies over workforces reduces the rate of industrial expansion.

One of the few bright spots in industrialized world economies over the last decade has been Amazon. As Amazon reduces consumer prices, it is effectively giving every one a wage hike. 

When prices decreases, people's salaries can afford to buy more. Consumer price decreases are therefore  technically an increase in real (inflation-adjusted) wages.

Amazon is giving every one a wage hike every year, and all of that is being jeopardized by this economically illiterate left-wing, that already destroyed US Steel, the Big Three Automakers, and the US passenger rail service.",1616989254.0,1

"&gt;Whether or not Amazon's e-commerce operations are subsidised by its other divisions does not change the thin margins on the operation itself.

Of course it does. There is no reason to believe they could keep operating as cheaply as they do without a massively profitable division propping them up. It's incredibly disruptive to national and local businesses to have Amazon expand on the back of another more profitable business. So much for ""business creation"" when you enter a market with prices you can only afford to offer because of another unrelated sector of your business bringing in billions while you offer poor conditions to your workers and actively stop them trying to improve them. 

&gt;tech talent and CEOs are not. 

They super are replaceable. In fact it happens all of the time that new CEOs are brought into being. Tech talent not being replaceable is laughable as well. Companies everywhere outsource tech talent, and though some of it can be brought back not all of it is.

My argument has nothing to do with the effectiveness or moral righteousness of ""trickle down economics"". I was arguing against the common misconception that Amazon (or whatever the hated Corp du jour happens to be) doesn't pay enough taxes. On the contrary, Amazon's avoidance of taxes is done by paying its employees. My point is that the taxes get paid, just not necessarily by the Corp. In fact, your whinging about how the stock packages go to the top brass proves my point and should make you happy from a taxation perspective, as those people will pay a higher tax rate than if those stock plans went to their lower earners.

You should learn the functional differences between corporate and individual taxation. Having an understanding of that ought to convince you that a company's retained earnings don't count for anything until they're spent either on individual taxable income or as an operating expense.

It’s makes switching your support elsewhere a lot easier. 

For example, places like Best Buy offer same day pickup or delivery in a few days and price match Amazon. Most grocery stores/super market (even small chains in my area) now do same day pickup or delivery (for free or a very small fee.) office supply stores now operate with fast shipping, delivery, or pickup and price match when they can. If you are determined to buy online and don’t want to use direct retailers most times on Amazon can be found on eBay for far cheaper and a couple day shipping.

Alibaba is a shit company that caters to sellers and not buyers. Sellers actually pay them fees to list and get special badges next to their name like “alibaba certified gold seller” or whatever. Most of the stuff that comes from there is complete junk so you have to be really careful because you will have almost zero recourse of it turn out to be shit. Shipping is also usually very slow. Amazon and local retailers can do as fast as same day delivery where as stuff from China may easily take 1-4 weeks. “Shipping” from China has also become ridiculously expensive. A lot of Chinese sellers hide their prices by selling you a 30 dollar item for 1.12 then charge you 40 dollars is shipping. So typically you need to be buying in bulk to make it worthwhile and you need to be prepared to handle major quality control problems. Buying direct from China is not usually worth it for the average consumer. There are exceptions to that but you’re really rolling the dice. And you might as well be playing against the casino.

Yes, and they're entitled to fair compensation to the service to their employer.

Any good employment contract should be negotiated on amongst equals, not by economically stronger parties imposing their will amongst economically weaker ones, because that regularly leads to exploitation. You must really naive believe otherwise (and that's me putting it nicely). 

Amazon might have the right to hire whomever they like, but little Stefan Schmidt has the right not to be pressed into a disadvantageous contract by being threatened with full unemployment. 

That's why the German private sector isn't such a shitshow like the American one, where employees aren't guaranteed as much as a *single* holiday a year.

As for health and safety and insurance coverage: It is not in the interest of society *or* the economy for workers to put themselves in harm's way in the line of duty and risk end up unemployment, debt or invalidity (or any combination of those) when something unforeseeable happens.

At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter whether *you* think it's right or wrong. *It's the law.* Employees are legally guaranteed this kind of protection, and if the employers don't like it, they can take their business to the Peoples' Republic of China for some slave labour.

A lie is a lie. Maybe you don't know it's a lie, and are unwittingly regurgitating it, but it's a lie nonetheless. It's not exploitation when someone makes an offer, and another person willingly accepts the offer.

If you think it's exploitation, then don't accept what they're offering. Put away this victim narrative. It's dishonorable and exploitive.

&gt;Wow, terrific insight. I don't know what things are like on the other side of the Atlantic, but here in the German lands, indentured servitude was abolished centuries ago.

It looks you're being overly emotional and not understanding the concepts you're referencing. Indentured servitude didn't allow you to quit. With Amazon, you are free to quit.

&gt;Yes, and they're entitled to fair compensation for their service to their employer.

Legally, socialist laws can entitle them to many things that they are not morally entitled to, and this is one of them. What's 'fair compensation' is the compensation that Amazon offered, and they accepted.

They are not children - stop infantilizing them and claiming they're victims for accepting terms of employment that you find unfair.

&gt;Any good employment contract should be based upon a consensus amongst equals, not by economically stronger parties imposing their will upon economically weaker ones, because that regularly leads to exploitation. You must really naive believe otherwise (and that's me putting it nicely).

Again with you pushing this braindead socialist victimhood narrative, that does  nothing except appeal to people's emotions and reflexive envy toward, and suspicion of, the wealthy.

Any employment contract that is freely agreed to IS based upon consensus amongst equals. The economically stronger party is always equal to the economically weaker party, in its right to offer any terms it wants, and refuse to agree to anything it doesn't want.

The only power the economically stronger party has in free market contract negotiations is to offer the worker better terms than the next best option available to them. They cannot force them to accept terms that are not better than their next best option, because the worker can simply refuse those terms, and accept the better one.

Apple cannot force me to buy an iPhone, no matter how much it's worth. Amazon cannot force me to work for it, no matter how much it's worth. The only power both of these $1 trillion+ companies have is to offer me a product/service/job that is better for my interests than anything else available on the market.

"For any readers of this sub with a little intellectual self-respect left, I just want to point out that this article is just speculative propaganda disguised as news.

Amazon has over a *million* employees. 1.2M last I saw, more than half of which are ""labor"". TFA looks at a grand total of *three* Twitter accounts to justify the alarmist claim of an ""army"".

Is Amazon manipulating Twitter? Maybe. Are pro-union forces manipulating Twitter? Maybe. 

The fog of war here is dense. Don't fool yourself into thinking you know more about what's going on on the ground than you do.

But do demand better evidence than three account mentions to justify the FUD of an ""army"". Could I find three suspicious pro-union accounts? Obviously. If I wrote an article featuring those with claims of an atroturfed pro-union army, would you be as credulous?

And apply a little statistical common sense. Even if just *one percent* of employees were honestly anti-union, and only half of them were on Twitter, that's still six thousand legitimate accounts making anti-union statements.

Articles like this are absolutely trash clickbait. They don't actually let you know more about what's going on. That's bad enough on its own because its a waste of time. But what's worse is that they make you *think* you know more, and falsely reduce your epistemic uncertainty.",1617050999.0,-1

Wanting Amazon to be an EVEN BETTER option for them, when its already their best one in the whole world, seems a bit odd. Also, its actually the stress on efficiency and production that allows them to be able to afford to have a high minimum wage and benefits etc. in the first place, which is of course why people choose the job. but then they want to force the company to make the job less stressful aka less productive aka less valuable.

Now that I've made it clear I'm not some Amazon shill, I've got to play devil's advocate. They have some decent points with their tweets, even if they were made in poor taste.

Tax loopholes exist because our legislators have allowed them to exist. Maybe close those loopholes so they can't be exploited? Until that happens, companies like Amazon, Walmart, and many others will 100% do whatever they can within their legal means to pay as little in taxes as possible. It's ridiculous to assume otherwise.

And I love Bernie, but it is a bit disheartening to learn the minimum wage in his own state is under $12. I would have really guessed that he would have it at least at $13 or $14. If you, as a Senator, can't implement that in your own state, it comes across as a bit hypocritical to demand everyone else implement $15 minimum wage. Lead by example.

Again, fuck Amazon, I'm with Sanders and Warren on this one, but I think it's important to see both sides of the argument and hold our elected officials to the same standards that we demand of everyone else.

"I have several concerns about that paper.

The first one is how much of my time was probably wasted by reading it. I really wish I hadn't read through the entire thing on my phone before looking up who that foundation's donors are-

**Current CTIC Supporters**

* Amazon
* AT&amp;T Inc.
* Charter Communications, Inc.
* Comcast Corporation
* Comcast Innovation Fund
* Google LLC
* GSMA
* Microsoft Corporation
* National Science Foundation
* NCTA
* Penn Global
* The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation
* Verizon Communications Inc.

The authors claim to be completely independent, but given that list of donors, we would all be laughably naive to assume that the choice of topic or the 20 networks they included are perfectly representative of the few hundred that now appear to be operating in the U.S.

The paper states early on: *""Although some day people may need the download speeds that FTTH makes possible, the evidence suggests little need for such speeds today.""*

It also has an anecdote attributed to ""FCC"" sometime in 2014 with no actual citation regarding availability, % uptake, or whether there are less expensive competing providers available of simply: *""The U.S. take-up rate of gigabit service remains very low""*. A reminder again that this was six years ago, and we have much higher bandwidth demands these days.

Yet shortly thereafter, it states: *""It also runs the risk of obsolescence should a better technology come along.""*

So the authors' premise 5-6 years ago was that nobody needs gigabit. But we shouldn't invest in gigabit because it might become obsolete.

Squeeze this sentence in between those above on the same page, and you have me wondering which NCTA lobbyist wrote it-  
*""Wireless technologies—such as 5G—and legacy copper technologies—such as G.fast—are also exploring ways to provide gigabit speeds without incurring the cost associated with FTTH.""*

The data starts in 2010 and ends in 2014. I don't know if you recall, but the economy wasn't doing so well in 2010, and 2014 was 6 years ago.

I'd like to see some updated data for all of those projects, and data for networks other than the ones these authors chose. I didn't catch what method they used to project future revenue and am curious how accurate their projections were, since their conclusions were based on them.

The worst thing that I could take away from the paper is that municipalities may need to budget better than the majority of the ones studied within. Municipal fiber isn't a factor at all unless there is no existing service provider willing to provide acceptable service at reasonable prices. It only exists to fill a gap in commercial service. With Verizon and AT&amp;T both halting further FTTH expansion and the majority of cable broadband services having no competition at all, municipal broadband is the only effective way I see to get underserved communities reasonable service.",1617085213.0,1

"Although there is no universal definition of 'middle class', and often-used metric is 'households with an income between two-thirds and double the national medium'. So, for the US, which has a medium household income of around $70k, that would mean you would need a minimum of $47k household income to qualify as middle class, which translates to $22.50 per hour for a single-earner household, and half that (on average) for a two-earner household. So, a household with two wage earners both working full-time and being paid the average Amazon warehouse worker salary ($14 per hour) would indeed qualify as middle class.

"We’re given quotas and work that are best described as inhuman feats. They want robots and so they treat us like robots. I worked there for four months - and please don’t write off my work as not being there long enough, because I’ll explain.

I joined around the holidays. I was a picker - meaning it was my job to drive around a little forklift with a cart on the back and pick up items to transport to sorting, packing, and shipping. These items ranged from headphones to, I dunno... a 30 ft roll of carpet. Both items count as one “pick”. Both items are on opposite ends of a 1 million square foot warehouse. And you are required to pick 60-120 items per hour depending on your assigned location that day. Except the locations and loads are really arbitrary and it can be totally expected of you to pick one item at one end, then be assigned an item at the other end of the warehouse, which takes roughly eight minutes to travel on your 5 mph vehicle (later lowered to 3mph because we had so many crashes - one involving myself when I passed out at the wheel from no sleep). 

Amazon also counts the time in between your scans. If you take longer than 10 minutes to scan your next item, that’s considered Time Off Task. And that count be the time that you need to go to the bathroom, park your vehicle, do your business, then get back on and travel back to the next pick. The bathrooms were also on opposite ends of the warehouse and quite far from any vehicle parking space, so you also have to factor in walking time. This also happens when you need to refill your water bottle. 

So let’s just say peeing in bottles isn’t just for drivers. 

Next, schedule. 40 hrs regular work, 10 hr shifts. My shift was from 6 am to 4 pm. I’ve discussed elsewhere how break times worked and I didn’t really eat my whole lunch. 

Now, Peak Seasons like cyber Monday and Christmas and Prime Day, you’re required to work 2 days overtime. 60 hr work week during those times. It’s not optional. It got to a point where I was spending more time at work or asleep than anything else. I didn’t feel human anymore. I would get up, go to work, come home, lie there like a sack of shit and cry. Rinse and repeat. My husband didn’t recognize me. 

But that’s not why I only lasted four months. About three months in I started having crazy pain in my wrist. I couldn’t bend it back and forth and it would shake like crazy when I tried. I got it looked at and it turns out I needed surgery. But the surgery would put me out of commission and unable to lift more than ten pounds for more than a month. I couldn’t afford to take off work, so I asked my managers if I could switch to a lighter job - they did have one section that was mostly books and small items, things I could easily pick with one hand. I was told that’s not possible. So I continued to work... until one day, rushing to stack up cat litter boxes in my cart, my wrist popped and I could no longer lift ANYTHING. I was sent to the infirmary who couldn’t see anything wrong and they were only equipped to treat dehydration and minor cuts. I was given a foam wrist band that did nothing and sent back to work. But I couldn’t move my hand anymore. So I was sent home. 

At that point I really needed surgery. But since the incident happened at work, I was sent to Amazon’s workman’s comp doctors. The first one took one look at my x ray and said yes, this happened at work, we’ll take care of it. I came back for a second evaluation so we could get started. The first doctor was gone and I was told I could not see them. This doctor gave me another X-ray and said they couldn’t see anything wrong. I was told I must have a preexisting condition and Amazon wasn’t at fault. I said whatever and tried to go to a private doctor. My private doctor said it was work related and they couldn’t handle it if this was an open workman’s comp case. 

So I did physical therapy which didn’t help and made the pain far worse, for an entire year while I fought Amazon. I got a lawyer. They kept me on their employee registry with no pay for nine months h too finally firing me for not showing up to work. During that time I had tried to file for reasonable accommodation, I had a doctors note stating that I needed light duty, and I was told I would not be accommodated because the employee rules said I had to be able to lift 42 lbs no matter where I worked.

Amazon settled out of court a year later for $3,000. It was the best I could get. When I saw another doctor, I was told that the injury had healed... but it had healed very, very wrong. The surgery required now is heavily invasive and I may never be able to draw again if I get it. So I chose the pain instead. 

That’s what it’s like there.",1617114916.0,-1

Change can be adopted more quickly by people than it can be adopted by designing, assembling, programming and deploying automation. A company may choose to build fully automatic systems, to prove a point, but doing so on a grand scale can be much more costly than paying a living wage. Added bonus is the employees and other people making living wages can afford to buy more and/or better made things. Better made things are more sustainable and durable.

"Amazon workers in Germany went on strike at locations nationwide following a call from service trade union Verdi. The four-day strike was planned for late Sunday, with workers demanding the e-commerce giant raise wages. Strikes were planned for Amazon locations in Werne and Rhineburg, which are both located in the western German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Amazon locations in the cities of Leipzig and Koblenz will be impacted, along with two locations in the town of Bad Hersfeld in Hesse. Why does the union want higher wages for Amazon workers? ""Amazon is making a mint in the coronavirus crisis. For this reason alone, wage evasion must be stopped there,"" Verdi representative Orhan Akman said. Amazon's profits have skyrocketed during the coronavirus pandemic, as consumers turn to online shopping at home instead of going out to brick-and-mortar retailers.

Akman has accused Amazon of not adhering to social distancing guidelines which are intended to keep employees safe from infection. The company has rejected the accusation, and said it has taken additional measures to protect workers. ""These include increased cleaning and disinfection intervals, temperature measurement when entering buildings, mandatory masks, 2-metre distance rules and staggered shift and break times,"" Amazon said in a statement Sunday evening. Amazon locations in Germany have been targeted by union-led strikes since 2013. Amazon workers in Italy organized a strike last week, with labor representatives calling on the company to share its profits with workers.

The strike comes after the company announced Friday it would hire 5,000 new employees in Germany this year. This will increase Amazon's workforce in Europe's largest economy from 23,000 to 28,000 employees.

Germany is Amazon's second-biggest market behind the United States, where the company is headquartered. The e-commerce giant was founded in 1994 by Seattle-based entrepreneur Jeff Bezos, who has now become the world's richest person, according to US business magazine Forbes. In addition to strikes in Germany and Italy, Amazon is also dealing with a possible backlash from workers in the United States. Amazon workers in a Bessemer, Alabama warehouse will finish voting Monday on whether to unionize. The results will determine whether Bessemer workers will establish the first US labor union in Amazon's 27-year-long history. wd/rt (dpa, Reuters)",1617122234.0,1

No. And this shows that the argument about principles isn't about principles at all. They only want to share in their employers' success, but not in its failures. They get the guaranteed wages, but take none of the underlying business risk. For ten years while Amazon was losing money, these people didn't work for free.

I don't say this to say ""unions are bad!"" They're not any worse than employers. But the important point is that *they're not any better*, from a moral perspective.

That is patently false. Under the National Labor Relations Act, a company cannot close a location to break or avoid a union. Sure, they can say it's for something else all they want, but closing a building right before or after they are about to vote would be seen as illegal. 

&gt; Judge: ""Guilty! You are sentenced to a ridiculous fine of $12Billion dollars""

Possibly, but there is also the very real possibility that the company could be forced to re-open or pay the people that lost their jobs any lost pay and benefits. You are trying to say that every time. Sure it would be appealed and maybe some of it would be clawed back, but eventually the cost of keeping the union would be a lot less than 12B. If you seriously thing that keeping a union out of any company is worth 12Billion then you are insane. The added cost in pay and benefits to even the most generous Union package to a company like Amazon wouldn't even amount to 1BIllion a year. 

But let's assume that they stand their ground and refuse to re-open and are ok with a steep fine. You think that would put out the fire? If they are pushing to organize in ALABAMA, what do you think is going to happen in their centers in NY, CA, NJ? Amazon going to shut all those down too and then pay multi-billion dollar fines on each one of those and sacrifice operations in states with the largest population centers?

"If people are provided with more free time (eg 3 day work weeks), demand for arts and entertainment (travel, etc) goes up.  

However, the biggest issue is increasing creep of requirements and complexity to do the new jobs.

When those jobs are gone, it doesn't matter how many new entertainer or AI programmer jobs are created, those unskilled workers will never be able to perform them.

The other big issue is slow shock.  If industries like taxis and long haul trucking are automated over a 10-20 year period, that will displace a very large number of people in a short amount of time.   You're not training a 47 year old truck driver to become a programmer, even if he would have had that possible skill set if he been trained at it as a 20 year old.  You're not stuck with a large % of your economy out of work in a short period of time with no hope of getting them back into productive work.

"&gt; trickle down effect

""Trickle down"" is a term typically used to describe 'supply side economics', which is a very specific and widely discredited form of economic policy.  However, other then the unfortunate usage of that term, your question clearly has nothing to do with that policy. Instead it is asking very good question about impacts on demand for certain goods and services if there is less overall demand (less jobs in the economy, less spending, etc).  It's a valid question; *if Walmart cashiers no longer exist, does that mean that Amazon will need less programmers?*

The answer is, it depends.   If you have two Walmart Cashiers making minimum wage below the poverty line and they're both out of work due to automation.    If one moves to permanent welfare (which is basically where he started) while the other is retrained and becomes a windmill site operator which has much more value and disposable income, the demand for luxury goods might go up and society needs even more programmers!

If you have a good safety net, everyone is probably better off.  You can see this concept over time in real life.  If you're only ability today is to scoop manure from horses on the street...well you're unemployed and will never be employable.   But instead we're all better off today and we get to drive around air conditioned cars instead of paying a bunch of people to pick up horse crap.

But...that's if you can transition people.    If say, all of the trucking, taxi, warehouse, retail, agriculture, and manufacturing automations occur at the same time all within the next 10 years, there is going to be way too many people to move to new jobs.   And at the same time, jobs reliant on those jobs are going to disappear (rural communities, gas stations, local retail stores, etc).    And if all that happens at the same time, demand for services takes a big hit, which means less stuff is purchased, which means less need for programmers to build new websites.  Oh, and 10s of millions of people will be out of work and won't have money to even buy food or pay for rent.   Basically, like the worst part of the pandemic, but permanent.

This is why people keep talking about things like UBI.   If you don't provide a safety net for people as their jobs get automated, they'll never have the time/resources/ability to retrain for the windmill job and we end up with even more people on social programs permanently.",1617143172.0,-1

Been a dev for about 20+ years. In the UK there already is a union and nobody joins it because they mostly don't want it. However since there is also a skill shortage and probably will be for a very long time anyone with decent skills dictate the market to the employer not the other way around like amazon does with warehouse workers.

That particular industry is suffering from a different problem which could cause it to be unionised though which is that its being flooded with under skilled and under qualfied people for the jobs from th euniversities. Basically the academic side is massivly detached from the industrial side of things.

Another part about that is the reason for flooding the market with partically/badly trained people is they want to dilute the wages so that programmers are in high demand. It works to a certain level in some of the trade for relativly simple jobs. However the really complex ones its having the oppostie effect where I am located.

"I like anything that starts with; ""Regardless of which side you're cheering for in this battle, don't fool yourself into thinking you actually know anything about what's going on.""

And the fake Amazon employee played by the fake Amazon social media manipulator could be an Amazon employee faking badly to get caught because they are ACTUALLY working for Amazon as a consultant!

Anyway, I think Amazon should have Unions or we should actually thank them for their incredibly efficient delivery system, pay the stockholders and then nationalize it. Then every company can use this for sales without a monopoly choke hold.

That $15 an hour they tout was only recently offered as a way for Amazon to save face with Bernie Sanders calling them out. 

This can be a great warning that makes executives stay up late at night. Just ""bam!"" Forget about unions -- you've been NATIONALIZED! And then they will forever fear. 

Instead of fighting these companies abusing monopoly, we just need to take whoever has the most efficient business model that can be reproduced and codified and then make it part of the infrastructure. Next year; maybe Walmart.

And if government screws it up  -- they can create something more efficient and compete. Good luck hiring away higher paid workers though.",1617145458.0,1
"While I'm sure some are against unionizing for ideological reasons or from believing Amazon's talking points.

What is really being voted on is the risk of retaliation and job loss if Amazon leaves the area.

Hopefully this doesn't happen, if I understand correctly, it's a new facility, so that would be a big waste, but we'll see. It would certainly send a strong message.

I wish articles were framed this way, it is not the desire to be in a union or not, it is the fear of job loss.

Also, based on some interviews I saw, Amazon warehouse in that area pays less than smaller warehouses where their owners are not the richest people on the planet. All the messaging from Amazon is a slap in the face to anyone working there.",1617145508.0,1
"You need support, but not as consumers. Consumers have no power. They are individuals. When you say to people to boycott, you are asking individuals to forgo something with no gain to themselves. Consider the scale at which this would need to be done to cause economic disruption to Amazon. And then what are the demands? Who represents the boycott? Who does amazon talk to? There are none and there is nobody because consumption is an individual activity, not a collective one.

As workers, organized together, people have the ability to shut production down. And, its in people’s interest to organize this way, because our workplaces are the primary area where we interact with the broader world. Better conditions, more pay, all come out of this as well. You’re not asking people to sacrifice, you’re asking people to fight alongside you for something better than themselves.",1617146653.0,1

"Bezo's net worth is almost entirely based on the *valuation* of Amazon. That is to say, Bezos owns about 12% of Amazon's stock, and Amazon on the whole is worth about $1.5T.

In turn, a lot of Amazon's valuation is not based on their *present-day* bottom line, but their *potential* to grow further. Essentially, investors believe that Amazon has a lot of ""headroom"" to further expand its business model.

Bezos needs to sell to two very different groups. On one hand, he needs to sell to the consumer the idea of cheap goods delivered quickly to the doorstep. Much more importantly for his own net worth though, he needs to sell ""Amazon"" to his investors. He needs to sell the idea of a "".com gem"" where the sky is the limit, and happy workers sit on bouncy-balls typing code, and play ping-pong on their breaks. He needs to sell an idea of ""unlimited, unrestrained, and rapid growth.""

Union is a big crush to that, and I think that's just awesome, but I think he'll disagree. Union can put a big damper on that ""unlimited, unrestrained"" idea. Yes, they can increase pay and benefits, leading to higher labor costs. Yes, they can increase protections for workers, meaning that they actually get to use the restroom (and cut productivity by a few %).

It goes way deeper than that though. It depends a lot on what exactly goes into a union contract (which you can bet is going to be the target of intense industrial espionage). 

You can bet your life that if he could, Bezos would replace every last employee with a robot. What if that gets prevented by a union contract? They could put a clause requiring human monitoring of automation equipment, or they could simply say that ""employee job-categories must be kept to a \_\_\_% warehouse worker, \_\_% drivers, \_\_% loaders, etc.."" ratio, so they can't eliminate warehouse workers unless they eliminate all other jobs at the same time.

A union contract could (should) also heavily restrict subcontracting (such as contracted companies that do delivery). They could require that contractors be unionized as well.

The problem for Bezos, is not just the immediate hit to Amazon's bottom line (which he can absorb), but the hit to Amazon's *valuation:* it's capability to keep growing at the present rate for the forseeable future.",1617148860.0,1

"I have been back and fourth between warehouse and construction and the only comparable working condition to amazon would be roofing in the summer with break time including the time it takes to get off and back on the roof to work.

The pay rate is on the low end of the warehouse job market in my area and has constantly been that way. So you end up with an average to sub average pay there without working nights and for the warehouses that give differtial for weekends those as well.

The benefits for a single person is good but family is very lack luster. As in people paid for themselves and then got private insurance at times becuase it was the cheaper alternative lack luster. The 401k match is just there so they can say they have one. The one thing they had going for them was the stock options and that was gutted with the 15$ raise a cross the board. With the removal of that and VCP bonus the compensation total was at slightly less then before. (thought that is mostly due to stock option being removed.)

To add perspective, I moved to a union warehouse job and have better pay after dues. I can actually afford to add my family to my health plan. My 401k match is triple what Amazon offers. I have a bonus opportunity yearly, though not guaranteed. And working conditions are so much better I regret holding out waiting for the last of my stock to vest before leaving.",1617167004.0,1

"&gt; Amazon pays better than your average warehouse job, offers better benefits, and better working conditions.


I live 30 minutes from an Amazon warehouse.  I also used to be a warehouseman in the Sheet Metal Workers Union.  As a warehouseman, my take-home pay started at around $14.00 per hour, but the benefits were paid by the union, in total, I was making about $20 per hour.

The current rates for warehousemen who have been working longer than 3 months: $19.19 per hour take-home pay, plus $9.15 per hour Health and Welfare, plus $5.68 paid into your pension fund; this makes your actual pay $34 per hour.  Then your employer has to pay an additional $1.39 per hour for various things on their end.

"&gt; Oh there is no doubt Amazon is still underpaying

If Amazon was underpaying, they wouldn't have any employees. The 800,000 people working for them suggests they're, in fact, not underpaying.

There may be a lot of people wishing they made more (everyone wishes they made more) and there may be a lot of people who are struggling to make ends meet (even though they're making 2x what a lot of people make), but they're not slaves -- if they work they're doing was actually being underpaid, they'd be able to easily find a job somewhere else doing the same thing. If that's the case, why are they still working for Amazon?

People don't seem to get that you can't magically legislate a job into having higher value -- the market and competition set those values. If you turn one knob higher, another one has to be turned lower. That may be other things you lose, but it may also just be other people lose it all. 

Bezos may be the richest man in the world, but its not with money he's nefariously stealing from Amazon's employees. He's paid by the shareholders, and the shareholders are very happy with his success. He's not paid with any money that Amazon has. If he got no stock at all, there wouldn't be a penny more for employees.

"I have a feeling you do not know a lot of people that work retail/fast food/warehouse if you are saying Amazon is giving them a fair wage. Amazon _is still being competitive within the scope of ""low skill"" jobs_, but they are still horribly underpaying their employees. That is the whole problem with retail/fast food/warehouse work. Everyone is getting underpaid. I have heard all of the arguments you want to throw out ""get a real job"", ""it is not meant to be a career"", etc. But with these ""low skill"" jobs equating to such a large section of the job market, for many people that is the _only_ job they can get. The fact is that a low skill job in 2021 is not enough for a _single_ adult to have a studio apartment, a mobile phone, Internet and a car. In just about _anywhere_ in the US. Maybe if you really stretch it you can make it work, but if you have kids? No chance. 

Also, this actually something that both Amazon and Walmart (ironically) does _really_ well is the unproductiveness of schedules in these positions. I do not know how Amazon warehouse is, but Amazon CSRs have set schedules. Walmart does schedules out 3 weeks at a time, so not as good, but not as bad as other places like McDonalds, Mejier, etc. that does week to week scheduling. At many of these places it is impossible to keep a regular sleep or actually do anything _outside_ of work. Amazon for CSRs can and will set your schedule to something crazy like third shift and tell you accept it or quit. Retail/fast food will give you a closing shift (until 2AM) and then a shift at the earliest possible time they can (10 AM, federal law requires 8 hours between shifts). 8 hours is not enough time to get a shower, relax, eat food and sleep. The randomness of the schedules also makes it very hard to do things like go to school or learn a skill so that in 5-10 years you are not still working at the same location.

"Over the last 2 years I have worked directly with Amazon as a vendor and they have continued to push our relationship to the point of failure.

The company I work for sells about 2,000 products on Amazon and I work with an agency to manage the content, advertising, etc. Over the last month, we have been doing our AVN, Annual Vendor Negotiations, and I can only describe the process as as shakedown. As a vendor, Amazon comes directly to us with orders and houses our products in their warehouses.  In return for potential bulk orders and buy box priority, Amazon requests various allowances. Everything from damaged goods and returns, margin allowances, direct import, etc. Some of these can work in our favor, but most don't. The various requests Amazon has made this year and pushed our relationship with them to the breaking point. One example for you. Amazon wants net 60 terms with us and a 2% allowance for it. As in, they want us to give them 2% of our gross sales back IF they pay us what they us within 60 days. Prior to that, they wanted net 90 with a 1% allowance. We were left in awe of some of these requests. 

On top of all of this, Amazon started allowing vendors in China to directly sell their products to Amazon in the same way we do. Prior, you had potentially weeks of lead time for some orders, or Chinese vendors had difficult work arounds to get their products on Amazon... Now, nearly all of our 2,000 products have a knock off. In some cases, there may be as many as 5-6 vendors selling a knockoff of a specific product. They use our images. They use our copy. They use registered trademarks. They even use our packaging materials (instructions for example). Amazon does nothing to prevent this. Everything is on the vendor to police. Amazon has a brand registry, but it has done little to help us. You can't even use ™ or ® in your copy or descriptions on their site. 

Even worse, we spend potentially millions in advertising, only for our ads to be served up on the pages of the products that are being knocked off. So by allowing these knockoffs on their site, Amazon actually profits off the advertising the original manufacturers have to do AGAINST the very companies and products that knocking off the original. And if we don't, we lose sales. So we are stuck bidding against products we designed. 

At this moment, Amazon is one of our largest vendors, but that could be changing soon. It's sad for us because we see tons of potential. Amazon is our forcing our hand and I would assume the hand of many other vendors. This is not a good company for America.",1617203702.0,1

"Most progressives have a very sophomoric understanding of capitalism and how it actually functions in society. More than anything, Amazon is exactly what it says it is, Earth’s most customer centric company. 

In a capitalist framework, this means the customers experience of the products is of utmost importance, and everything at Amazon is geared toward delivering against that. However, it remains a company and its decisions are always already overdetermined by the imperatives of the capitalist framework. Personifying this in Bezos is the idiot move of a negative politics - if you removed Bezos it would just be something else because it’s systemic, not just the one symptom. It’s the progressive version of Trumps trade war on China. 

Amazon is a margin business, it only profits at scale, and you can’t simply undue that because of liberal feelies. 

It would take an actual politics that transformed the imperatives businesses must operate under, so that it wholesale changed the expectations of customers and the relationship between the market and labor power. That is to say, Amazon is exactly what it is because that is what customers want it to be. 

Customers want fast, cheap, and easy and the market is pulled to that impossible demand and those that come the closest to achieving that impossibility win. 

Until a popular politics marshals the power to transforms that, you just have utopian regressive conservatism, neoliberal fecklessness, and utopian socialism. The market is where the political decisions happen, but that’s to hard for progressives, who just want to rage at every symptom.",1617204328.0,-1

"No; I actually fundamentally agree with you. Every point you have made is absolutely valid and I agree with. 

However, you can't just nationalize companies because you think it would be good. You can have democratic ownership of the company via unions which will decide the best course of action for the company, democratically. 

Without that very important democratic detail, you end up exactly with the so called ""communist"" countries that have existed; a mere guise for authoritarian dictatorships. 

I mean, think about it. If the government can take over any institution it wants and make it ""public,"" that government now has absolute power. And that absolute power MAY be chosen by the people, or may not. So regardless, you wind up with an Authoritarian, and whether that authority is elected or not really doesn't matter much. 

Socialism, instead, makes much more sense. Democratize the workforce through unions. Not through forced government intervention. Provide base levels of equality such as health care, housing, and food. Allow the people to organize to earn better wages and benefits and own part of the company they work for, and they will work hard. Increase employee stock share programs.

They pay better wages than any of the supposed mom-and-pops they run out of business, too.

Added to that, Amazon as a corporation doesn't do buybacks (another evil of Reddit), doesn't pay dividends, and reinvests the vast majority of its profits back into the business, which includes constantly hiring more people at their above-average wage.  But the far left calls the reinvestment of profits ""not paying taxes"".",1617206532.0,1

These people could be replaced with an amazon warehouse worker, who would be more active on the job, and earning that 75K a year. Easily.",1617206543.0,1

They then replace these individuals with other individuals desperate for income.

Unionizing means making conditions much better so that the turnover rate isn't so high as the point of unionizing is to improve working conditions. But what are the things that would be negotiated on? Probably regular work schedules, higher pay, fewer hours, more breaks, and better benefits. These things can easily lead to a 20-30% increase in costs for their warehouse staff. This cost scales as each warehouse will have the same cost increases.

However a PR campaign is relatively static and doesn't cost as much as you'd expect. The PR campaign cost doesn't go up as Amazon expands.

"I mean the shitty warehouse conditions are everywhere. I feel like Amazon is no worse than most factories. I worked summers in a trailer factory in Kansas. The conditions were way worse than anything I’ve heard described about Amazon. They have heating/AC. We baked traitors then had to prep and paint them. Those bays (like 20x60 rooms basically) they cooked them in were around 500 degrees and to cool them they’d lift the roof up and lift the trailer out. So all that heat would go into the non conditioned factory. The only way the factory cooled is through garage doors around the outside edges of the factory that semis picked up trailers in. Being it gets 100+ for a good chunk of the summer we were cooling the shop off with 100 degree outside air. I explained all that so ppl know I’m not exaggerating when I say it was 120 degrees or hotter most of the time where I worked. And managers were no better than Amazon. If they see you at any point standing and not being productive you get your ass ripped or fired.

I worked the paint line for a couple weeks. I was leaning on a rail waiting for the next part to come through for me to paint. There’s literally nothing to do until it gets there as I’m in fully paint suit with powder paint gun in my hand. Manager sees me and yells at me “this here, leaning on the rail... that doesn’t help shit around here” and continues for a few more lines before moving on.

Moral of the story: maybe my factory was unique. But I feel a majority of factories are that way. All I know if the complaints Amazon workers have are 1st world problems compared to the issues the workers at the factory I worked at have. Most likely nobody cares though as my factory was a business worth a few hundred million as opposed to a couple trillion.

&gt; &amp;quot;Many of these are not Amazon FC Ambassadors - it appears they are fake accounts that violate Twitter&amp;#039;s terms. We&amp;#039;ve asked Twitter to investigate and take appropriate action,&amp;quot; said an Amazon spokesperson.

It may be more expensive to run a company that has a union or offers more benefits, but it might lead to less turnover if done right.

"Heh, I didn’t know living in Vietnam is a privilege position compared to being born and raised in the USA.

Nobody in good mental health would starve to death today. Even here where I live, a borderline-3rd world country, if you beg for some food, NOBODY would ignore or deny you in normal circumstances. But if you beg for money, well good luck with that. Here our trust for strangers start from dead Zero, especially anyone who asks for money. Not a single penny to give.

It is completely understandable if you want to pressure Amazon into giving workers better deal. But I don’t see this ongoing tactics as good strategy, or even as an attempt at negotiating “in good faith”.

From management standpoint, it’s not impossible for Amazon to accept a proposition and increase pay / improve working conditions. But it’s a deal, meaning workers have to improve on something at least. Tit for tat, perfectly reasonable.

You want to sell your labor high. Don’t blame Amazon for wanting to buy low. Everybody has their own drivers to lean forward in life and you have absolutely no right to belittle other’s resolution to improve their own earnings. We work under the same laws.

As a side note, in my culture the finger-pointing and moral dictatorship are absolutely hated. A decade before the Vietnam War we had a special kind of revolution during which a lot of farmers would point out anyone, ANYONE who did better than themselves and painted them as landlords, capitalists, oppressors, deceivers, all of whatnots. The result was ... hilariously tragic. Famine and economic collapse shortly followed.

I’m not bringing this up to mess with you.

"In regards to Sanyo, they were the poster-child for what Japanese companies got wrong with the internationa markets. Led to their demise. Instead of cutting costs and reducing unique features for cheaper products, they kept upgrading their appliances and trying to sell them at higher prices than the Chinese and American competition. They put R&amp;D and money into energy efficient, quieter machines with higher quality parts. In the end, international consumers bought the cheapest products possible. We are now in a perpetual downward trend of cheaper/shorter-lifespan appliances.

I think largely you can associate pre-60s American manufacturing as high quality, and pre-2000s Japanese manufacturing in that same standard. Steve Jobs brilliantly pointed out that while Japanese companies were obsessing with hardware, Silicon Valley wisely put its resources into software, as the decline in quality of hardware was an irreversible cycle.

You can call it greed, but it's really supply/demand, and the mass consumers' poor taste and indulgence (in overpaying for crap) that allows the rise of bad practice economics.

Just evil.

Another underhanded thing they do: Some high end A/V manufacturers like LG, Denon, and Marantz only honor warranties if the product was bought from an authorized dealer. Amazon ***is*** an authorized dealer of many high end products, but people on their site with storefronts are not. So you buy that $3,500 77"" LG OLED, and only once it breaks and LG refuses to fix it do you discover that it was actually sold and shipped by a non authorized dealer even though you were fooled into thinking you were dealing with Amazon. 

Contacting Amazon results in an email that says you should have paid more attention.

"...And then, Kindle happened, and hell broke loose.

Honestly convenience of ebooks is not a joke. It has changed my reading habits completely. Like, I used to never read in bed, because I was afraid I would fall asleep and crush the book under my body. Now? I have no fear of that. 

I can now read huge novels on the train. I have tiny hands (haha, trump hand jokes ensue), and I can not hold large (edit spelling) volumes with one hand while standing on a crowded train. Now the Kindle app is literally in my hand. on my iphone. I can read on the train now. 

Reading in bed and reading on train are now my favourite things to do. I hated the commute; now I love it.

the best thing? All my progress is saved in the cloud, synced to all my devices. I can read on my laptop (which I do frequently during coffee breaks), as well as on my mobile devices, without losing my place.

And I haven't even mentioned audible and whispersync, which have just made my exercising so much fun too.

"1. Amazon could have paid every employee a $100,000 bonus last year and still made record profits.
$15/hr is nothing to them. It's a simple PR strategy meant to provide a counter argument to how AMZ weilds the economic/ political power it has accumulated.

2. AMZ Fulliment centers, far from being a boon to local economies have been shown time and again to stifle the economy in the locality in which they are built. Armed w/ huge tax incentives offered by municipal govts, AMZ can offer a $15.00 min. w/ out touching their own money. They vacuum up the local labor mkt. Employers other than AMZ falter or move elsewhere. (As their taxes subsidize their demise). A couple yrs later, local economy and AMZ are synonymous. Every job directly or indirectly relies solely on AMZ. This leverage is unsurprisingly gargantuan. (to the point the its mere implications are enough to keep everyone ""in line""). 

3. Your avg fulfillment center employee has little chance at upward mobility. A local economy dominated by AMZ fulfillment tends to suffocate all unrelated to AMZ. In an AMZ FC my best shot at professional development leaves me with no real marketable skills.
In a diversified local economy I have countless more opportunities to acquire skills that provide a foundation for professional growth. My experience provides options and therfore leverage in negotiation with employers. The above dynamic does/ cannot exist in a local economy that revolves around a single employer's low skill job offerings.

4. As AMZ has scaled up the above dynamic has migrated up the supply chain. We are at a point now when even fortune 500 companies tremble at the notion of being cast out of AMZ's good graces. Companies like UPS, with revenues equivalent to a small country's GDP are at such a disadvantage they gladly accept terms sure to eventually relegate them to status of contractor servicing routes too low margin, too cumbersome, too far toward the fringes of AMZ's internal logistics network. 

5. Standard Oil, US Steel, etc paled in scope to today's monopolies. They used the same tactics (providing slightly higher wages, leveraging economic weight against municipalities &amp; vast political capital against state &amp; federal legislators, etc). 
They were vilified then as they are today for good reason. 

6. Defending Amazon because they offer a min wage slightly higher than market is preposterous. It's like rooting for a man who offers $10.00 daily for life so long as you never seek money from anyone else vs. the woman who offers $5.00 today while she trains you in a skill that will net you $100.00 a day in 2 years, open opportunities for higher pay yearly after that. 
You've been sold a lie. Markets while essential, are not without fault. They are mearly the descriptive of trade; a tool for exchange. Like other tools, they are best used as part of a set of tools.

"I agree that they are still a small % of all retail, but when you run THAT much e-commerce and still rely on your cloud business to make you profitable, then, in my opinion, you are not playing retail fairly. 

They keep their profit at zero because it makes it that much harder for competition to keep up and the modern world doesn't expect businesses to be profitable, just sales volume and growth %.

Amazon is a master of the volume over profit model, and it comes at the cost of fair competition. Not to mention, it will always be hard/impossible to call any company a monopoly if they don't actually make any money. 

My main point is that it is a dangerous game for anyone who wants to become Amazon's competition in the e-commerce space. Also that much harder to survive/protect their market share if Amazon wants to start selling to a new customer base.

In a fully competitive market each market participant competes to zero profit. Amazons long term strategy has been to invest in automation and technology so it will always be able to make just a little profit when others cut to zero.  This is ultimately good for customers because it has induced others to invest in productivity which leads to lower costs and better prices for everyone.  Amazon does not have an unfair advantage from size - it has had an advantage until now because it similar outworks and outsmarts the competition. And I absolutely guarantee no one in that company thinks that they have it made made and can sit back and relax - they saw how they came out of nowhere in 20 years and have every belief anyone can outwork and outsmart them.

&gt;So this is Bezos, literally ordering his people to violate the terms of service of other sites (creating fake accounts).

Do you have a single bit of evidence at all?

Because Amazon doesn't need a shit army of trolls to do this shit.  There are legions of anti union folks who need zero permission from amazon to do this at all.

I've worked for Amazon. If people are shitting in bags it's because they're gross people, not because they're being mistreated.

Shit employees cant be terminated because the union puts up so much red tape (very similar to postal workers for example).

Rather than being able to hire and fire until they get the best people for the job, or people who want to work, they get stuck filling quotas and trying to pick up the slack of protected lazy people.

As they vote to unionize one by one all Amazon has to do is do what I stated originally, give them lower pay and benefits in the proposal, let them strike on that basis so they have the right to replace them, then reroute packaging temporarily through the other operating warehouses until new hiring is done. It's not worth the headache for grocery stores with small numbers of people to fight unionization, also they aren't asking for much.

It's quite easy to find leading or quickly growing players in an industry without being the supplier/provider. In addition, it sounds like Amazon is simply understanding what market needs is being solved rather than the proprietary tech behind it. Which again can be easily researched.

They were worried that it was antagonistic. On mobile but I encourage you to google it as I’m sure it’ll be a quick find. 

The fake fake account concept is remarkably old despite its increasingly larger role in online astroturfing. Right now the general internet audience understands deception one meta later deep - evident by this thread claiming Amazon is faking (1 level) accounts to astroturf unionizing efforts. 

What the general internet audience is still struggling to understand in herd clarity is the idea of creating fake accounts (1 level) designed to appear fake (2 level) to intentionally make a party seem guilty of deception (Amazon making fake accounts) in such a way that is hard to refute (prove you didn’t make the accounts/prove a negative). 

This is recognizable in Qanon astroturfing (not to be confused with just general conspiracy posts pertaining to Qanon) where those who disagree with the herd are called shills, by actual shills who wish to maintain order in the communities messaging. I’m using the word shill here in their communities context, not my own. 

We see the same thing in WSB with GME. 

Online information is a weapon in the correct form but it’s a weapon that can only be used in a way that appears authentic to the message, or else it’ll appear forced and therefore have a stronger inverse reaction. This is a bug for those committing deception at level 1. But it’s a feature for those operating at level 2. 

Amazon workers have cried out to the nation and press for support in help with unionizing, but all it’s gotten them is a general consensus Amazon mistreats it’s employees and no change. But if Amazon is caught in what *appears* to be cheating, then suddenly the involvement of spectators grows enraged, Amazon the unbeatable corporation appears unworthy of having its side heard, and questions about Amazon’s true nature are asked by people who can influence and pressure Amazon to change, such as allowing unionizing.

They are also networked together, so commanders back at base can effectively see what soldiers are seeing in real time, and soldiers can receive live footage captured by drones. The mobile computers, which are fitted with artificial intelligence chips, also track soldiers’ eye and hand movements live, and monitor what they say.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, developers also used the goggles to test soldiers’ temperatures.

The headsets have been nicknamed “FrankenGoggles” by some. Some soldiers who have used them say they are as intuitive as the iPhone or likened them to following video game instructions. They first underwent army field testing in October 2018 after Microsoft won a $480m contract to provide the army with prototypes.

Close to 100 Microsoft employees at the time petitioned the company to cancel that contract, arguing that it should not develop “any and all weapons technologies”.

Peter Singer, who studies the future of warfare, said the goggles were a “remarkable” development that could deliver quicker and better decision-making to soldiers on the ground, but warned that they could also face information overload and the risk of faulty data.

"After the UAW took over the US auto industry in the 1950s and 60s, the Big Three Automakers contracted, Chysler almost went bankrupt, and Detroit went from the highest income city in the US to a decaying ghost town.

The same thing applied to US Steel when its workforce unionized. The US passenger rail services fared worse, with all of them going bankrupt after the ""Brotherhoods"" took over and forced them to meet their exorbitant demands.

Now the US is uncompetitive in many areas of manufacturing, and what are people advocating?

Unionizing the workforces of two of the few bright spots in the US economy, and major sources of US export growth: Amazon and Tesla.

(copy-pasting)

Granting labor unions monopolies over workforces reduces the rate of industrial expansion.

One of the few bright spots in industrialized world economies over the last decade has been Amazon. As Amazon reduces consumer prices, it is effectively giving every one a wage hike. 

When prices decrease, people's salaries can afford to buy more. Consumer price decreases are therefore technically an increase in real (inflation-adjusted) wages.

It's exactly this process of rising efficiency driving down consumer prices that is responsible for real wages increasing 20X since 1820, which gradually lifted people in the West out of poverty over the last two centuries, and is now giving them life-giving capabilities in producing delivery drones that can safely distribute goods during pandemics, mRNA vaccines for COVID and possibly next cancer, and affordable N95 masks.

Amazon is giving every one a wage hike every year, and all of that is being jeopardized by this economically illiterate left-wing movement, that already destroyed US Steel, the Big Three Automakers, and the US passenger rail service, and made the US mostly inhospitable to manufacturing.",1617287247.0,1

"&gt; Most progressives have a very sophomoric understanding of capitalism and how it actually functions in society.

So do most conservatives, or liberals, or libertarians for that matter. Most people seem to pigeonhole themselves into one specific cure-all ideology and ignore its flaws when convenient while laser-focusing on the flaws of others and ignoring their advantages.

The apparent assumption as well that the progressives are all poor and whining about not getting handouts or whatever is also incorrect - plenty of people in high paying dev jobs at these companies _are_ progressives, likewise, plenty of those on the floor at fulfilment centers are going to be conservatives who are against this.

&gt; In a capitalist framework, this means the customers experience of the products is of utmost importance

Rarely. All the hate aside, Amazon is relatively unique when it comes to major corporations and its internal cultural ethos of customer experience above all else. Do you think the companies like Apple and John-Deere currently fighting against right-to-repair legislation are honestly doing it out of the goodness of their hearts for the sake of customer satisfaction? No, of course not, they're doing it because monopolizing the maintenance of their planned-obsolescence based products in order to encourage people to upgrade every couple years or buy overly expensive full replacements instead of just fixing simple issues is far more profitable for the company than just letting people own what they paid for.

In a capitalist framework, maximizing profit is of utmost importance, nothing else. Amazon happens to think good service is an effective path to maximizing profit, and for them it was true, especially early on when ""internet shipping"" was a burgeoning new space with tons of competition, and it helped build the company's reputation and retain customers. Not all companies do that though, because not all companies _need_ to do that in order to boost profits. It would be _nice_ if that was a universal inherent incentive and everyone just did the nicest thing to make everyone happy and usher in utopian libertarianism, but they don't.

As for warehouse workers, it's possible to be profitable while also adequately paying employees, or at least it should be, and if you aren't able to then your business should be considered non-viable. Maximizing profit is all that matters, if pure capitalism had its way, the Amazon warehouses would be staffed by slaves or managed like old Foxconn plants in China. As a society though, the wellbeing of its citizens should be a priority, and that includes warehouse workers who enable you to get your knickknacks in only two days.

&gt; The market is where the political decisions happen, but that’s to hard for progressives, who just want to rage at every symptom.

It's ironic how you call out progressives for having a ""sophomoric understanding"" of capitalism while making it quite clear that your own sophomoric understanding of progressives relies almost entirely on dumb strawmen.",1617345093.0,1
"This is the problem: US media is thoroughly unionized. They gain extra-contractual rights, at the expense of their employer, and any outside workers who may want to compete for the jobs, as a consequence of their union membership and left-wing US labor laws that suppress their employer's contract liberty.

So they have a financial conflict of interest in how the public perceives disputes between unions and employers.

Here's a counter argument to this socialist argument being offered by the unionized journalist:

(copy-pasting)

After the UAW took over the US auto industry in the 1950s and 60s, the Big Three Automakers contracted, Chysler almost went bankrupt, and Detroit went from the highest income city in the US to a decaying ghost town.

The same thing applied to US Steel when its workforce unionized. The US passenger rail services fared worse, with all of them going bankrupt after the ""Brotherhoods"" took over and forced them to meet their exorbitant demands.

Now the US is uncompetitive in many areas of manufacturing, and what are people advocating?

Unionizing the workforces of two of the few bright spots in the US economy, and major sources of US export growth: Amazon and Tesla.

This is why the US can't have nice things.

Granting labor unions monopolies over workforces reduces the rate of industrial expansion.

It's not in the interest of the average person in the US to handicap Amazon's expansion. As Amazon reduces consumer prices, it is effectively giving every one a wage hike.

When prices decrease, people's salaries can afford to buy more. Consumer price decreases are therefore technically an increase in real (inflation-adjusted) wages.

It's exactly this process of rising efficiency driving down consumer prices that is responsible for real wages increasing 20X since 1820, which gradually lifted people in the West out of poverty over the last two centuries, and is now giving them life-giving capabilities in producing delivery drones that can safely distribute goods during pandemics, mRNA vaccines for COVID and possibly next cancer, and affordable N95 masks.

Amazon is giving every one a wage hike every year, and all of that is being jeopardized by this economically illiterate left-wing movement, that already destroyed US Steel, the Big Three Automakers, and the US passenger rail service, and made the US mostly inhospitable to manufacturing.",1617347682.0,-1

"&gt;Except you can't change laws with contracts, so this works both ways.

Yup most people doesn't realise you can't just draw up a contract that says anything it wants. The law typically sets limits on what can and cannot be specified in a contract and also what is a fair clause.

In this particular case the contract between customer and service is owned by uber and uber is responsible for the sub contractors actions of discrimination.

It might be different is the service was run different for example. You ask the app for an uber and the app shows you drivers willing to accept the contract and then you select a driver to come pick you up then you pay the drive and uber charges the driver a ""finder fee"" for the customer.

Thats basically uber being a contract negotiator and handing full responsibility of the contract and fullfilment of the contract to the driver.

These kinda cases actually open up a can of worms legally. Things like ebay, amazon market places. If i buy something from amazon and I am not aware its a 3rd party for example. My contract is with amazon and if the product breaks or is defective amazon is who I have the contract with and is on the hook for the defective item.

Well, not exactly. a law defining planned obsolence, and how it is punished, was voted.

And it was used in 3 legal actions:

* One against epson, accused of planned obsolescence with ink cartridges. epson won.
* One against apple, when the phones with a worn battery started to slow down. Apple lost the case, based on the lack of information provided to the consumer, but the ""planned obsolescence part"" was rejected, because ... it was not. Apple's fault was they did not immediately tell customers the update would slow the phone in order to prolong battery life. Which was the right way to do it, and is currently applied on every phone in the world. Because it prolongs the phone's life !
* finally one against amazon, again for the lack of information on legal warranty. And it was rejected again.

If they threaten your job or try to discipline you (which I would also not be surprised about with Amazon), that's different.   


I agree with u/texasspacejoey here. This is common in all delivery jobs. It's not ""officially"" encouraged, and supervisors would rather turn a blind eye than find a solution. I feel like this has become an issue with Amazon simply because they are currently receiving a lot of flack on all sides regarding their treatment of employees. I'm not saying there's nothing wrong with it, I'm saying that I bet this has been ongoing since the get-go with Amazon and it's not necessarily any worse than it was. It's simply just another issue to bring up against them - rightfully so.

&gt; Amazon has posted an apology to Rep. Mark Pocan for a tweet last week denying that it makes its workers urinate in water bottles.

&gt; The controversy started with a tweet by Pocan blasting Amazon for its treatment of workers-a topic of particular public interest as workers at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama were voting on whether to unionize.

&gt; The next day, Vice published a story with the headline &amp;quot;Amazon Denies Workers Pee in Bottles. Here Are the Pee Bottles.&amp;quot; It included a photo of bottles with an Amazon worker&amp;#039;s urine in them.

I think they are fighting it tooth and nail because they wouldn’t be able to change and throw stuff at the wall and see if it sticks as much with a union. Amazons success is pivotal to being able to change and experiment with as little red tape as possible. I think an Amazon specific union will be ineffective because a lot of the issues they are trying to unionize for are because Amazon is expanding so quickly there is a major disconnect between corporate and what’s happening on the ground floor and Amazon will fix them now and then what bargaining power will the union have? A warehouse union that includes associates from all industry leaders would be much more effective.,1617488466.0,1

That's why. If it's any consolation us smart people are voting for being in favor of such things as unionizing. It's just that (as 2016 showed) there are PLENTY of actual real honest to god objectively-stupid idiots out there.

Know why people ALWAYS jump RIGHT to ""OMG OMG! Those poor Billionaires being picked on!!""

those are not the smart people that vote. I mean let's be honest, they DO vote, but it would be LARGELY against their own belief system to vote for anything ""the other side"" votes for because they'd been tricked for **decades** into believing such things (such as ""no! we can't unionize, those companies will simply uproot and move to a different country literally tomorrow"") and as such, **always vote against their own well being.

I actually think for unusual things, sometimes going directly to a manufacturers’ website is better anyway.  

For example, I am a really into baking, and at the beginning of lockdown I couldn’t find certain baking supplies (including even yeast) for love or money.  Amazon had yeast, vital wheat gluten, etc., but marked way, way up through third party sellers.  I eventually found some websites for specialty kitchen stores that had everything I needed and even with shipping I paid less than a third of Amazon’s cost, and was able to help some small businesses that were closed to the public at that time.

So far this month, I’ve used Target for delivery (haven’t heard anything bad about them, but am open to being educated.) I have a Costco membership and am about to pull the trigger on the purchase of some housewares for my son’s college apartment that were actually going to cost MORE on Amazon.

I needed some new running shoes, and Amazon had a smaller selection of the Brooks I wear (via their ownership of Zappos), and could get them to me faster, but Brooks’ website had a bigger selection and got them to me almost as fast.

"I have worked for two 3rd party Amazon delivery company. A manager for one and currently driving for my current one. 

It is 100% on Amazon. Amazon sets the delivery times. Amazon sets the package count. Amazon sets the routing and it is AWFUL!

Amazon has an algorithm that predicts how fast a driver should be moving. What sucks is that this algorithm does not take into account taking any 15 minute breaks or your lunch. So if you take those, you will essentially fall behind. And that's when Amazon management will begin to hound the managers on why their driver is suddenly behind schedule. Once you fall behind, it's so hard to catch back up unless you start cutting corners or you receive a rescue. 

Amazon also sets a big package count on us. During peak season, it's a bit easier bc Amazon allows the companies to hire more drivers and thus spreading around the packages more evenly. But once that's over, Amazon will condense routes adding more stops and more packages. We also have to load our own stuff every morning so it's such a hassle when the package count goes up. 

And for some reason, Amazon has the absolute worst routing I have ever seen. I constantly have to check my route bc Amazon will route things in such a way that will actually make me lose time. There have been times where I deliver in an apartment complex, go back to my van only to find out that I have another stop inside the same complex. For some reason, they are separate stops and not grouped together even though they're in the exact same building. There's times when my 17th stop of the day and my 75th stop are literally next door neighbors. Why are they so far apart in the route? No clue. There's times when they schedule business stops at the end of my day and I have to return them bc the place closes. It makes no sense.

Google will do what it does publicly to provide a sense of protection as it always has, but if you take time and dig thru the fine print on all Google products, you agree to let them sell every single micron of data you give them access to. Apple does not.

On the other hand, their overall effect on the society in what concerns workers' rights, environmental impact and predatory business practices is absolutely terrible and it needs to be seriously hold accountable for their actions.

The board has told Ms Cunningham and Ms Costa that it will file a case of unfair labour practices against the online retailer if Amazon refuses to settle the case.

My main point though is that “Amazon pays no tax” is a lie and if we try to exaggerate and remove nuance from situations, we’ll likely never get anywhere developing solutions.

"That’s because of the US tax system and the fact that most people don’t understand how it works and why.

To understand why Amazon has taken so long to pay taxes, you need to understand that they only started making a profit due to their cloud business maybe 5ish years ago. At this point, retail is profitable as well, but back in the day when Amazon only sold books and even when it was a smaller marketplace, it was taking huge losses every year. 

We like to encourage businesses, especially growing innovative businesses, to continue to grow by allowing them to earn tax credits when they have negative income. So if Amazon lost $10B one year, they might get a $2B tax credit to apply to future years. They also lower their taxable income by investing huge amounts into R&amp;D and writing off capital investments incrementally via depreciation 

Perhaps a minimum tax rate for large established companies makes sense. But I agree with why Amazon didn’t pay tax for a lot of its existence at least, it’s just that they rapidly rose from unknown loss-making company to multi-industry behemoth. I just hope people on here don’t want to do things that would discourage innovation like taxing R&amp;D spend and removing tax credits for growing companies that are sustaining losses.

"It doesn’t matter what effect banning Trump had the point is that the act of banning him did not keep people from talking about him, which is what you said social media companies could do.

Of course there are rules that play into what a private business can do but there are limits on what those rules can do too. The governments authority is not absolute. The first amendment would certainly prevent rules that forced a bookstore to sell certain books, and so it would also prevent rules that forced Twitter to distribute certain speech. It doesn’t matter if it’s intentional or not either since, otherwise Christian bookstores are super guilty of censorship.

"Yea but if you only interview 3 black ppl a year haha 

This is why I don’t like having this conversations because they’re anecdotal. I know we’re talking about Facebook but this happened with Amazon as well. 

Amazon is never going to show us the racial makeup of the applicants they push through the interview process. I’ve read comments from ex Amazon employees who were part of the hiring process,  who claim that out of 1k applicants for a job when it dwindles down they ended up interviewing no black person. One person said in their 4yrs they interviewed 1 black person, and that was in the thousands of applicants. 

If you (not talking about you OP) don’t want to believe these FANG companies are that  bad, then you’re going to say well “that’s one department ” “it’s only 3 ppl”  whatever because it’s a seen a “luck of the draw” or just part of the hiring process. 


We’re  never going to get “proof” because the proof lies with the person who’s trying to act like the good guy.

Ive watched a green engineer get a job over me. Someone  with  2 masters and speciality in what the company was  doing.  some of the engineers who interviewed me recommended me for other positions in the company! And raved about me. 

it could be because I’d be more expensive. I’m not sure. When I hear you’re not a “good fit” but on paper I literally am, I’m left scratching my head. You clearly didn’t want someone with more experience this dude hasn’t even graduated yet. Multiple members of the team liked me? So why wont fit in this mostly white male dominated company?

"So, as a guy who works at another Big Tech company, but not Facebook, let me give you a few complex issues that I think Facebook faces:

* Targeting ads based on your interests / likelihood of converting
* Tagging users based on facial recognition
* Improving search results
* Hosting videos, including streaming, encoding, etc.
* Filtering spam and illegal content
* Recommending new friends / groups
* Messaging
* VR
* Marketplace, which is a different search / conversion equation
* Doing all of the above at massive scale
* Having enough traffic you can't host on AWS or use off the shelf tech in many cases
* Having enough code that traditional version control and build systems don't scale

A lot of this involves tons of ML at its core. Ad networks have to be *fast*. Search has to be fast and relevant. Both have to take into account your interests.

Scale is a challenge. I can think of several times when I've had to work around standard library or language limitations to deliver software. Some ASM here and there, knowing language internals to avoid garbage collection or extra allocations in tight loops, etc. Sharding, weird geographical routing techniques, etc. 

Suddenly NGinx is too slow; can you build a faster one that fits our use cases by not caring about the general use case?

It's harder to find people who can do all of the above. Facebook et all want people to be interchangeable. Yes, there's a ramp up period, but you've got to be able to learn it if required.

Because Amazon is able to avoid taxes and expenses most up and coming companies cannot they were able to sell cheaper and a usurp customers. It is essentially being funded by the government to grow a private business where other companies would have to pay out of pocket for the same things.

&gt;If they want workers to go to them, they pay more than the local market, if they don't people don't swap jobs. 

No, amazon already does pay a lot. This supersedes local market forces.  


&gt;If amazon comes in, and the companies want to retain their workers, they match what amazon is offering or more. Amazon offers 5k more? 

It’s not $5k more. It’s $50k-$100k more at least unless there’s already a big tech presence in the area. You have no understanding of this industry.

&gt;Company that really wants to keep their top performer matches that 5k and gives an extra week of vacation. Amazon has cheaper insurance or perks that old company doesn't have? How about another 5k in salary to match that benefit that we cant offer.

$5k is nothing in this industry. The differences in talking about are $50-$100k or more in comparison to the existing jobs in the new areas even considering same job title. 


&gt; I don't know where you get this notion that other companies are all of sudden shit tier. They need employees on a fundamental level, and if they lose their good employees because they aren't competing in compensation, they stall or go out of business.

Because this is literally how it works. 

Low tier companies like airlines or car companies or even big banks like chase are very easy to get hired in and don’t pay much.  They pay like $60-$80k. 

High tier companies like amazon or Facebook are hard to get into and pay a lot more and hire globally.  They pay like $150-$200k. 

If amazon moves into your basic area where people are making $50-$100k for professional roles, they’re going to be paying $200k to people who definitely aren’t coming from those local low tier companies *unless* those individuals can actually meet the hiring bar, but that’s a minority.

&gt; While the vote has not been completed, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, or RWDSU, the union seeking to represent the 5,800 workers in Bessemer, has already said it would challenge the vote by filing unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB. It will allege that Amazon broke the law with some of its anti-union activity in the run-up to the election.

"Maybe I over simplified, what you're saying is totally true, but from my perspective it doesn't change the meaning of my comment. I think the difference in perspective is that in my view, Jeff may have created and lead the company, but it couldn't even come close to existing without the people doing the actual work. Capitalism rewards (as it should) starting something new to compete, but that reward is incredibly disproportionate to the amount of work put in, especially when the company becomes autonomous from Jeff and continues to make him enough money to give every single worker in the company a 100k raise and still not lose money. It's an ideological difference though, many people believe so strongly in that concept of ownership that they believe he has right to continue to profit over everyone else's effort because he started it. I believe that's as ridiculous as saying an olympic coach deserves the medals their athletes win because they recruited and trained them, but I respect that your belief might be different than mine on the matter. You may see Amazon as an asset, which is valid, but I see Amazon as an organization of people, and I don't believe owning people is a good thing (not trying to compare them to slaves, obviously they're free to go)

Capitalism with wages can be re worded to ""paying people less than they're worth for services"" because if everyone was paid in accordance to their worth, profit couldn't exist, since that value was generated by the workers. In this particular case, most workers are being paid a small fraction of the profit they generate.

&gt;I think you are also either A) over estimating how much Bezos has, or B) under estimating how many people Amazon employs. 

""Bezos's net worth grew by $75 billion in 2020, according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index.""

Number of employees: approx 1.2 million

75 billion divided by 1.2 million is 62,500

So you're correct, my numbers were wrong. I'm guessing my source used an old number of employees, because they hired 400,000 people last year

But say they didn't hire 600,000, or the raise was 60k instead of 100k which works, then assuming Jeff's wealth would increase linearly from 2020 onward, that wealth increase could cover those wages. Obviously it doesn't work that way at all, especially since net worth isn't liquid, but it's still a bit wild that the factory workers are treated the way they are considering those numbers. They should either be paid way more since the job expectations are ridiculous, or more people should be hired and the job expectations should be lowered. They're not exactly paid poorly in comparison to other workers in that industry (though I'd argue _all_ the workers in that industry, probably all industries even ones like engineering, should be paid better) but they are squeezed harder and treated worse.

Comparing an average employee to an Olympic athlete is a bit strange though. Olympic athletes are highly trained highly specialized individuals.

I agree that not everyone should be paid the same, and I didn't mean to compare the average worker to an Olympic athlete. The athlete was supposed to be a metaphor for the entire organization minus the primary shareholders, and the trainer was supposed to be a metaphor for the primary shareholders. 

Also, most importantly, wages don't reflect value at all as it stands currently. Pay correlates with number of meetings attended, so the more critical work you do, the less you get paid. Not at all suggesting that management or meetings are a waste, but I don't think middle management needs to be making double what an engineer makes, and I don't think the CEO needs to be making roughly 375,000 times as much as a SDE II

"FLoC is best thought of as a way to keep personalized advertising viable as people reject directly personalized practices. In other words, it's Google's attempt to figure something out that is good enough to make advertisers happy while also better respecting user's privacy. 

It's important to remember that Google has generally made their advertising fortune on contextual advertising which doesn't even need cookies and tracking. The problem is that efficacy aside, companies want *more data* on their users. So Google loses customers to shady companies that literally sell their products on fancy ways to build user profiles. They fingerprint browsers and IP addresses, and match it with data from Facebook and Amazon and other online sites and mobile apps. So Google is trying to strike a balance. They don't really offer that kind of information on their users, so using FLoC, they can describe a generic ""user of type X"", and without revealing direct personal information, give the kind of profiling that other companies sell directly.

Ironically, I find that in the industry, marketing departments make a huge stink about needing all this deep data, and at the end of the day, they proudly proclaim whatever they want to find anyway by drawing conclusions from whatever supports their goal. Some company that sells shoes will develop a whole campaign to sell some specific brand to 40 year old women who just had babies, paying for ads from Facebook that allow them to do that kind of targeting, and make huge presentations on how they came up with using the word ""comfortable"" in connection with flower petals is going to boost sales, and at the end of the day showing a text ad on Google that requires no more specific information than that the search was for ""comfortable women's shoes"" is just as effective.",1618372093.0,1

"&gt;This could've easily been stopped if the average person was more aware of their representative's behavior.

Even if the average worker was more aware of the actions of their company, they do not have any mechanism to actually change their position. They do not have ownership of their full value. The value they produce is owned by the company they work for. They are able to keep just enough of their full value to stay on top of bills to pay for basic necessities. Not enough to actually increase their position.

Warehouse jobs can be thought to be the new ""factory job"" in America. It is a basic entry level job that pays decently well.

If we look at a company like Amazon which has a large amount of power, wealth, and political influence, and has a lot of warehouse jobs. We see that they say they pay better than minimum wage ($15/hr) when in reality, that wage is actually much lower than the standard warehouse job actually paid, and actually drove down the average wage of these warehouse jobs. When some of these workers tried to unionize, the company used their power to bust it. That's still happening.

&gt;This isn't inherently a bad thing, it motivates creation of new companies. However, it is a bad thing when companies are so large that starting a new one or finding alternative work that treats you better is hard.

You're ignoring the possibility of the workers outright owning the factory. The middle man (the company) doesn't perform any of the work yet keeps most of the produced value.

Since the workers and the owners have different levels of ownership and different priorities, guess who's priorities are actually acted upon? Obviously, the people with more ownership and more control. Which is a smaller number of people. The workers are the majority and produce the value of the company, yet their needs are not met since their value is controlled by the owner class.

Simple solution, is to remove the owner class and give the workers direct ownership of their workplace and to vote on how to allocate their resources. Rather than giving the power to allocate resources to another party with interests that do not align with theirs.

&gt;Companies create value in the same way that copyright and patents were intended to create value; by incentivizing creation.

These companies essentially just hold capital and can use it to buy material.

Raw materials are only worth as much as raw materials. If a worker doesn't turn it into something else, it's only worth the cost of the material. The real value, is produced by the worker.

There is no reason for the intermediary. Give the workers direct ownership of their workplace.",1618493873.0,1

"&gt;Umm, he already is. Isn't that what Amazon is?

Not sure I follow you here, unless you're arguing that Amazon is inherently good simply by virtue of being an employer? Because no, Amazon is a corporate entity ruthlessly maximizing profit at the expense of their employees' well-being and happiness in many cases.

&gt;Which happens to be a damn good way to get the most benefits out of a given amount of resources. The trade-off is called 'waste'. Waste of time, waste of money.

Again, I'm not sure I follow. By ""trade-off"" do you mean ""alternative""? Because a ""trade-off"" is generally the downside to an otherwise positive solution to something; I'm taking your comment to mean that Amazon extracts ""the most benefits"" (for **whom**, by the way?) from a given amount of ""resources""- what you're choosing to call human beings- but in so doing wastes a lot of time and money.

If I understand correctly, you're arguing that dehumanizing people is the only way to avoid waste. If this is indeed your argument, then I strongly disagree. This is a false dichotomy; it's absolutely possible to humanize the people working for you *and still* be efficient as a corporate entity. Besides, *even if it weren't*, then I'd argue that many folks would prefer that corporate entities be less efficient in exchange for better lives for their workers.

&gt;Consumers do the same thing. Do you think that Amazon has much power to raise prices? I don't. I think that they would get crushed by other competitors.

I never suggested that Amazon raise prices. I'm suggesting that Jeff Bezos use his extraordinary and historically unprecedented wealth and power to improve the lives of the humans who put him in that position with their hard work.",1618527677.0,1

"It's not ""someone else's problem"" it's ""Amazon employee problems"" and Bezos (for the sake of this argument) is Amazon. His wealth is built on the back of those Amazon employees and the business practices which see people from all segments of the supply chain exploited to maximize profits. You have still yet to explain how it is the consumers fault.

And yes, he may not be directly responsible for every issue at Amazon (does that even need saying?), however he absolutely has it within his power and means to ensure that the issues the average Amazon worker faces could be resolved, if he so wished.

And yes, as I've already said, people DO understand how stocks and shares work, it seems it you that doesn't. The idea that because his wealth is directly tied to Amazon it somehow doesn't matter is absurd and naive and demonstrating a real lack of understanding of how the real world works. He is still wealthy, those stocks are still worth vast amounts of money and still represent huge power. 

Power isn't just how much cash is ""hiding under a mattress"" and in fact there's a very strong argument that cash carries even less weight than the bargaining power of a giant corporation. If Bezos had 100 billion in cash and no stake in Amazon, he'd have a lot less power than he currently does, which to be frank kind of makes your entire point completely invalid and irrelevant.",1618529746.0,1
"I have been working at an Amazon FC for almost a year and a half. Everyone there believes we aren’t paid enough.  And I can only describe conditions at the warehouse I work in, which is one of if not the most automated sites.

I am so tired of hearing and reading liberal voices decrying the awful conditions we work under, and I am a liberal Democratic voter.  

First, the pee bottles: that happens in the delivery company and while they probably due need more break time but truckers have long had pee bottles.

Second: twenty minutes total for bathroom breaks.  That keeps getting repeated and is wrong.  We get two paid twenty minutes breaks and a thirty minute lunch so there is plenty of time in those breaks.  And we get the extra twenty minutes that are not scheduled so there is time for a bathroom run or two or three. But that depends on if you are wasting time otherwise.

What management is trying to do is minimize time not working. So here is how it works. I clock in and then have ten to fifteen minutes to get to my station and log in which is plenty of time. If some reasonable thing delays my start I notify my manager who removes that from the twenty minutes. 

Okay so I sign in, get my station assignment and then decide to chat for ten minutes with a friend and get to my station five minutes late.  Twenty minutes less five.  

I go to the bathroom on my first break but get back to my station two minutes late. Twenty minutes minus seven.  I get back to my station on time after lunch. Between lunch and the second break I go to the bathroom and it takes eight minutes so I have five minutes. That coffee at the second break makes me take another bathroom break but this one takes six minutes. So I am over by a minute or so. Oh and I was not late getting back to my station after break two.

So what happens to me? Nothing. The people who might get fired are the ones abusing this and are warned repeatedly but keep on doing it. Also I get to leave my station five minutes before the end of my shift.

Speed requirements: I don’t mind them and these jobs are not for everybody because they are physically demanding and require mental focus and making good decisions. Our nickname for this is the Amazon Fitness Center.  So we laugh that this is the best fitness center ever and the only one that has paid us for working out. 

And only the slowest performers in any role are warned and they are allowed multiple warnings and offered retraining. And we only know of a few people fired at all.  And most of us like to complete with ourselves or friends to be faster with fewer mistakes. One NY Times op ed writer said the speed requirements stifle creativity which is so wrong. I can’t give examples as that is not allowed which is fair. But I know because I have come up with a change while working.

Also my FC is way nicer than any warehouse. And that is what everyone says.  Also most of this think this is the most friendly place we have worked. I have made some great friends. And for those who last there are many opportunities to move up or try doing different things.

Okay so you may know some of our benefits. Paid time off and unpaid time off.  Health insurance from day one. I have vision and dental and life insurance at a minimal cost. And for the younger Amazonians you can get ninety five percent of college tuition paid and your degree doesn’t have to be anything related to Amazon. And there are also like tuition programs for robotics, IT, and software engineering. 

So if you see me as a corporate apologist please remember that none of us believe we are paid enough. But that has been true in most jobs I have had.

If you want to ask me something I will try to get back to you.

They don’t win anything if a vote in favor of the union causes Amazon to pack up and leave to send a message. And it’s not like the state or local government would have their backs either.

"what i did was essentially backstock all day. not sure if you've seen the inside of an amazon warehouse or not, but they don't have rows of shelving, the merch is all stored on pods driven around by robots. you put what you can in a pod, then push a button that sends the pod out and the next one pulls up. it'll queue around 5 max for you, so you should always have several waiting. 

so, they track how many items you put in each pod, how many items you put away in general per shift, how long you are at your station, how many pods you turn away without putting anything in them, *how many seconds pass between each item scan,* and a bunch of other annoying numbers. if you get a large number of small items to stow, you can do so quickly, and it makes you look great. if you get a bunch of big items, that will obviously slow down your numbers, which you will be criticized for. 

they expect no more than ten seconds to pass between item scans. they run ten hour shifts and you only get two breaks from this, both half an hour, one paid, one unpaid. the time it takes to walk to the break room is counted as part of your paid break, and if you got unlucky and got a station that was a ten minute walk from the break room, oh well, enjoy your long walk and ten minutes of actually sitting down before you have to go back. 

if you drop below their rate expectations, they will come up to you and tell you. their managers are obsessive over it, i assume because they are told to be. even if you are a top performer, they will talk to you after even a single off day, or at least they did at the FC i worked at. no consideration given to the kinds of items you were given to stow, they went purely by numbers. the workload is infinite; you don't have to ""finish"" your work, because someone else will just take the station to continue when you leave, so... there's no sense of progress or accomplishment from it either. just mindless repetition, and they don't let anyone listen to music either. 

it was the only warehouse job i have worked, and i will not be going back. i didn't actually mind the work i did; i wasn't always stowing. sometimes i was filling other people's lines with merch to stow, and often i was moved to the pod transfer team, which assisted amnesty (the robot team) in moving full pods off the AR floor (where only the robots generally operate, people don't go out there unless authorized) and replacing them with empty pods. none of that bothered me, and it was often enjoyable, their obsession with numbers rather than treating their workers like people is what lead me to quit.

Break did not start at last task. You scan your badge on the wall scanner, usually the ones nearest to break room. 

Supervisors are available any time. Warehouse manager is at every weekly meeting.  Never seen anyone searched by security — you put things that would make the scanner go off in a bucket and walk through. 

No time off task for hurting yourself.  It’s continuously stressed that if you feel any pain to go to the office where they keep nurses on staff 24/7.  This visit is documented and I’d never heard of anyone getting any flak for seeing a nurse. 

Have to pee? I went pee. Needed to shit? I went shit. Still made way over my rate every single day.

Apparently the issue is more with how individual warehouses are ran than anything else.  Out of every warehouse I’ve worked at, Dollar General, Brookshires, Walmart, the Amazon one was by far the better of them. 

I know this will be downvoted cause “pee bottles” but this was just my personal experience in Kentucky.

"I read this book series growing up called ""Pendragon"" and it was kind of a shonen about parallel worlds and tipping their wold events towards a more promising, happy future for its people.  Instead of doom/despair/disaster.  In one of those worlds, where a company monopolizes everything to the point of creating a [Battle Royale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Royale_(manga)) within it, the company literally makes sure that technology in some areas doesn't advance so that people are kept at basically what they currently are at Amazon Fulfillment centers. (Where all the manual laborers are at, where even the 20 year olds are getting joint issues from the 2,000 squats a day or walking)

Amazon is basically this right now.  People are cheaper than robots for mass production, so long as you also control the peoples other interests outside of their job.  Increase the prices, reduce their pay.  You control their economy.  I worked for Amazon before and i never felt more like a slab of meat.  Like a cow in its cow pen.  I'm not exaggerating.

Spoilers... &gt;!The protagonist fails on that world in the Pendragon story.  Due to the corporation that rules the entire worlds economy, its people, and all things technology, they even made sure that its people lost their sense of imagination by making sure all clothing and buildings are gray and no music is ever made.  ""Art"" was the catalyst to that worlds positive future and theres this stockpile of art that was made before that corporation took power from nothing, kinda like Amazon, is reduced to ash.  No imagination/inspiration, no saving the people.  They build the clothes you wear, they build the robots that police the world, they build your food, and to further dash hope... they broadcast the ""Quillan Games"" that is basically Battle Royale.

"Okay, let's see what's in the letter:

&gt;If you read some of the news reports, you might think we have no care for employees. In those reports, our employees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots. That’s not accurate. They’re sophisticated and thoughtful people who have options for where to work. When we survey fulfillment center employees, 94% say they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work.

Oh wow, 94% of warehouse employees tell their employer they would recommend the job to friends! That's a lot! Isn't that about how many Russians voted for Putin last time Russia had an election? Of course, Amazon has the right to fire these ""surveyed"" employees for saying no on the survey... but yeah, we can tooootally believe the results of this completely legitimate survey.

&gt;Employees are able to take informal breaks throughout their shifts to stretch, get water, use the rest room, or talk to a manager, all without impacting their performance. These informal work breaks are in addition to the 30-minute lunch and 30-minute break built into their normal schedule.

&gt;We don’t set unreasonable performance goals. We set achievable performance goals that take into account tenure and actual employee performance data. Performance is evaluated over a long period of time as we know that a variety of things can impact performance in any given week, day, or hour.

Huh, that contradicts this report: https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516004/amazon-warehouse-fulfillment-centers-productivity-firing-terminations

&gt;A spokesperson for the company said that, over that time, roughly 300 full-time associates were terminated for inefficiency. The number represents a substantial portion of the facility’s workers: a spokesperson said the named fulfillment center in Baltimore includes about 2,500 full-time employees today. Assuming a steady rate, that would mean **Amazon was firing more than 10 percent of its staff annually, solely for productivity reasons.** The numbers are even more staggering in North America as a whole. Amazon operates more than 75 fulfillment centers with more than 125,000 full-time employees, suggesting thousands lose their jobs with the company annually for failing to move packages quickly enough.

&gt;The documents also show a deeply automated tracking and termination process. “Amazon’s system tracks the rates of each individual associate’s productivity,” according to the letter, “and automatically generates any warnings or terminations regarding quality or productivity without input from supervisors.”

And then the letter goes on to spew a bunch of bullshit about how they're gonna work on reducing injuries in warehouses. Well, DUH. Injuries cost Amazon money. The letter contains NOTHING about lowering insane productivity standards, because doesn't give a shit about its employees. All Amazon cares about is how much money they're making:

&gt;Our increased attention to early MSD prevention is already achieving results. From 2019 to 2020, overall MSDs decreased by 32%, and MSDs resulting in **time away from work decreased** by more than half.

Let's see... then they go on to brag about $15/hr starting wages in their warehouses and how that affects the local economy. That WOULD be cool, except this kind of work typically pays way better than that in the US. I mean, for fuck's sake, Wal-Mart pays $15/hr to start where I live, and there's no algorithm putting your name on the ""to fire"" list because you don't run from place to place like a fucking Sim.

Hilariously there's a whole section in the letter about addressing climate change, but no mention of any specifics. How about Amazon address the issue of products sold on Amazon being shipped from warehouse to warehouse to warehouse by truck and plane because of sellers using an algorithm that scrapes websites for lower prices, buys out the stock, sends it all to a pack &amp; shipper (in a state with no sales tax, of course), and then re-lists the product on Amazon at a higher price? https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20961523/amazon-walmart-target-package-delivery-sales-tax-montana-roundup

Then there was a 15 minute break. Which should be five minutes. You had only time to go to the bathroom. Most people stay by their stations as there was nothing they could actually have time to do in a 15 minute break. Even walking to the bathroom in certain areas took 5-6 minutes roundtrip.

Post covid no one actually knows who their managers are. Stand-up was removed. I worked different positions and warehouses at Amazon over the years.

I saw 4 other managers in the course of 8 months, never spoke to any of them. Don't even know if any of them were my managers. 

Your security must have been easy going, cause our FC the metal detectors went off constantly. Each shift leaving had multiple people lined up to be searched.

"This OP, while I'm not directly disagreeing either, does seem to neglect the glaring fact that Amazon's employment numbers have come to far overshadow many other similar employers on local and national levels, drawing business from retailers and, since they started using their own delivery, both consumer and business logistics.

If I'm a relatively unskilled worker in and my skills and employment history seem to steer me towards warehouse work so I can allow my young able body to be exploited in exchange for hourly pay, and say for any number of reasons a lot of these commenters are happy to share, I don't like Amazon specifically, and I don't want to work for them. Suddenly that filter makes finding work that's relevant to me considerably more difficult since Amazon owns so much of those industries.

Since this OP commenter appears so aware of their freedom from forced employment and freedom of choice among (mutually interested) employers, I'd hope they're also rational and responsive enough to at least consider that excluding a massive, reliable employer that occupies multiple lucrative industries may not be a good idea.

"I started working at an Amazon factory recently and my experience has been that Amazon treats us well, free annual work shoes, good pay, 2 30 minute breaks, nice pay, and health coverage. My 2 complaints however are 1 the quotas. They want you to scan and stow an item on average every 8 seconds, realistically including bathroom breaks, drinking water in their not so air conditioned facility, opening and breaking down cardboard boxes, internet randomly dropping, the system sending you full/unusable shelves, and putting up empty totes, you need to scan and stow an item in 3-5 seconds. That’s easy when you get a box of phone cases or vitamin bottles but less so when you get a pallet of dog food or other bulk goods. My second complaint is abusing the seasonal hire laws to scam new employees out of benefits. Seasonal get like half the personal time as regular employees and that’s what you have to start as. I was brought on as a seasonal hire in April yet every time I ask my manager, problem solvers, and HR about when the seasonal period ends all I hear is “if you keep your numbers good they’ll upgrade you to a regular employee”. If they lowered their quotas to something reasonable and stopped hiring people as seasonal to scam them it really wouldn’t be a bad job.",1618590334.0,-1

Motivation? I remember when I used to have to go to work I had to.....Oh Yeah.. ***Work***, because that's what ***they pay me*** to do.

On top of that, was the candidate blind, deaf and dumb all throughout the interview process? Because I can almost guaranfuckingtee that they were informed of their **pay**, **work conditions**, **work responsibilities**, issues they might have with time missed and the reprimands that follow them and any other violations, and overall performance expectations during the interview and screening process. Which, in a M. Night Shyamalan twist, the candidate agreed to all of this before starting work there. So to say that they are treated so poorly and that they deserve better is absurd. You agreed to work there, if you dont like it or deem it unfit for you, then leave.

&amp;#x200B;

***But I can't get a job anywhere else***\--

***NEITHER CAN WE***. We are stuck here, because this is the best this town has to offer. We can't find work anywhere else, in part due to: Criminal history, lack of experience, no education, job requirements are too difficult to meet, etc. I can sympathize all day long about that, because I was stuck in that same shit storm for 10 years. Just because I was a manager, doesn't mean that my job was any easier, or payed way more. It sure as hell didn't, it payed shit and i was miserable. but it's what I had to do if I wanted to make money because it's all that was available to me or my crew members. It all comes down to one thing: ***Make the best out of a bad situation.***

Don't make it worse for everyone else because you don't like your job. Bitching and moaning isn't going to get any of us anywhere. If you don't like it, leave. You have nowhere else to go? neither do we. So let's work together instead of making Bobby over there pick up your slack because you're too sorry to quit.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Why the hell would they work hard when they're being payed less than what should be the minimum wage? You get what you pay for

This. THIS is the most childish and ignorant fucking thing I have ever heard, and I hear it a lot. Who is this sentence directed towards?

A few things.

1. Your manager **does not and will never be able to** set company wages. Your manager **does not and will never be able to** set the national minimum wage. Your manager has a base line employees experience and authority, but with a title slapped onto his name badge. Not a single place in corporate America does a Manager have the authority to do anything remotely close to this. They could ask the DM, or the DMM, or even the Area or Regional manager. But they have ***ZERO authority***. That's why my group of guys, who worked on the side of the interstate repairing vehicles for hours and hours on end, only got paid $10/hr. Ten dollars an hour. No commission. No pat on the back. Just a set of shotty knees before you're thirty and a chipped tooth from getting smacked in the face with a crowbar. As a manager, when one or even ALL OF THEM calls out, I had to stay until someone could show up. It's a 24 hour business. You ever worked a hard manual labor in the southern heat for 44 hours straight? Probably not. I had to do that multiple times month. I worked harder than any of them, i wasn't some fat fuck manager who stood by and pointed fingers, I set the standard. and I did it well. because its my job and its what im paid to do. I fucking hated it, but I had nowhere else to work. I had nowhere else to go. ***I made the best out of what I had.***
2. EVEN IF they were to have the ability to change the pay, ***your performance sure as fuck won't reflect anywhere close to what you're demanding.*** Grow up and get to work, or get the fuck out. If you're not contributing you're only getting in the way and causing the rest of us to do more work. Saying you're work $20/hr because your rent is too high, well find a job that pays that much because neither you nor I have any control over that shit. I have had to scrape by my whole life, this whole Amazon debacle and whatnot is nothing new. This has been the norm for decades. We can bitch and moan and cry and scream all we want, change doesn't happen. Only the illusion of change, with a fresh coat to cover up all the corporate bullshit. They still fuck you, just in a new way you're not familiar. Until you catch on, then they switch it up again.

&amp;#x200B;

People need to realize that, if you live in America, that this is the land of ***opportunity, not guarantees***.Most of us will work until the day we die, and some of us will be successful off the backs of others and never work another day again. Either way, none of us can stand by and expect a handout. If you don't like your job or the situation you're in, then change it. If you're unable to change it, well get the fuck in line because a lot of us can't either.",1618604133.0,-1

No. Because minimum wage employers gain nothing from giving they're employees raises since there are always a hundred people who are just as qualified looking to fill any given position.

I being a salaried employee decided to volunteer (only out of complete curiosity) to help cater hot food to their employees. ( I worked in the motor repair garage, we had a portion of our establishment in food service. I’ll let you figure out the rest) and I will admit one thing:  it’s like clocking into a prison out there. They are BEYOND STRICT on every single thing you do. So that I can see as off putting.

That’s some friend who wants you to be miserable, am I right?it’s not the most glamorous or easiest job, but by today’s standards it’s a fucking cake walk.  Regardless of their security. 

We signed a contract to cater chicken and pizzas, but we still had to wait 40 minutes in a holding room before we had clearance just to enter their cafeteria. And we had  to have a ID badge, hand over our license, and metal detector.  They have those turnstile(?) entrances, only its 8 feet tall. Employees are closely monitored. Everything you own goes in a locker. And they have someone with them at all times. I really don’t believe that they would deny them a bathroom break, let alone let them piss in a bottle, in front of everyone, at an assembly line. It just doesn’t add up for me.  Being reprimanded for taking too long is understandable. Don’t take advantage of your bathroom breaks.

"First, disclaimer I'm not a security expert. I just read the occasional security blog and install things that get recommended - possibly to my detriment!

But yeah, VPNs are a level up from this. A rough hierarchy would go something like:

* Use some kind of cookie blocking addon or built in browser feature. This helps prevent some persistent data between sessions. This is where your browser stores a cookie file with various settings in it that shares with website when you make a request. Such as click on a link. This is useful in some cases because it lets your browser remember you're logged in to services you use frequently even if you restart your computer. But doesn't protect you from those services just cross referencing your IP address and fingerprinting your browser each time you make a request. So even without cookies you're not really safe.
* Use some kind of script blocking addon like umatrix. This lets you outright prevent a website from forcing you to make requests to websites without your consent. Do you really want to access [y](https://twitter.com)outube.com when you're on reddit? Or do you just want to click through to youtube videos and have some degree of separation between the two platforms. The problem with this though is you're still going to need use a 3rd website, say one that uses recaptcha or cloudflare from time to time. And that leaks information to those services.
* One solution to this IP leakage is to use an addon like [DecentralEyes](https://decentraleyes.org/) that tries to refer requests for popular javascript libraries such as JQuery / React to a supposedly privacy supporting service. This one is a bit of a coin toss. Do you trust one person to not share you data about all the popular javascript services you use? One person that hoses JQuery AND React AND all the other things. Or do you want JQuery and React AND all the other services to have a little information about you. If you can trust the single source of truth then clearly that's preferable, but if they're a malicious actor then maybe there's more privacy from having your data spread around across multiple services? Also, there's the possibility that the scripts they host have call home features hidden in them meaning even though you download them from a 3rd party they've hidden some feature that allows them to contact the original host anyway. Without reviewing every line of code this is difficult to know - but with an addon like umatrix you're kind of protected from these leaks since you'd still have allow them to contact that domain.
* Another solution to IP leakage is to use a VPN. Which is more comprehensive than a mirror service for SOME sites like Decentraleyes. Because to the VPN is effectively mirroring everything to another site. But the downside here is you have to pay money. And you also have to pay for them. As for which is the best option, I'd say shop around and switch ever once in a while?
* In spite of all this. [You can still be fingerprinted](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/). Maybe you have to give google access to use recaptcha but you're using a VPN so they can't tell it's you by an IP address. Now they try and figure out who you are from fingerprinting your browser. What version of the browser you're on. What resolution your display is. What timezone you're in. Which fonts you're using. Run that EEF test to see how unique you are. Though in some cases the information your browser is providing this test might be faked to help prevent this kind of identification - lying about your resolution and what fonts are available, lying about the browser version, and changing these between each request.

How deep you want to go is up to you. Some people are happy with browsers blocking cookies. Some go deeper. And at the end of the day it's probably inevitable that they'll figure out who you are. So it becomes a question of just how concerned about your privacy you are. I mean half the web is stored on Amazon servers these days. If somebody REALLY wanted your data then it's probably not too hard to figure out. But as an average joe who just feels a little creeped on then umatrix or something similar is probably plenty, maybe use a VPN for security reasons if you also would use it to bypass regional content restrictions - say sign up to US only streaming service from the EU. But that would be illegal and I don't recommend it!

To answer your question specifically about having multiple devices sharing a connection. Yeah, that's another source of information leaking as well. For me, using an Android phone and how that means any app I have installed can check my Wifi information. This means apps can check ip address/network name, and other networks I travel near thus giving geolocation info even when I have location tracking off. This means I could never achieve true privacy. But with umatrix and a vpn I probably cut down on 90% of it. And that means only 10% of the customer service reps I speak to have video footage of my feet while I take a poop, which is better than nothing!",1618972249.0,1

I told him I couldn't possibly have done that and asked how he got my name and number.

"nobody's saying that you can't make the app... ML tech has come far enough that any CS undergrad could build these things with enough dedication and using the right framework. It's not about whether the tech exists, it's about whether there's any real chance that the very specific worst-case scenarios you're describing will ever happen. And more specifically how catastrophizing hypothetical outcomes distracts from real, present issues.

your idea that the existence of predictive/classifier algorithms will directly lead to convictions based on AI testimony is one big issue. even if AI was offered as 'expert testimony' in and of itself, it would be subject to the same scrutiny and cross-examination any other expert testimony would be. likely far more so honestly, due to inherent (and very justified) concerns of current ML accuracy. AI may add a new type of evidence, sure, but no more so than any other expert witness does, which are rarely a legal 'smoking gun' anyways. 

More importantly though, the whole 'alexa evidence' thing is fundamentally flawed from the start because they, at least officially, *aren't* always storing your audio like you're saying. It's been litigated a billion times, but mainstream smartspeakers constantly record only short audio loops, and then clear their cache without transmitting non-triggered recordings to the home server. Yes there have been issues of Google employees being given unauthorized audio samples to review trigger phrase accuracy, which was *extremely* fucked up. And I'm obviously not denying that Google or others may still secretly be storing info in a way that covertly violates their own t&amp;c. I wasn't born yesterday, and I literally do work in data science personally as well (though not at those orgs). We've also all seen how the AI ethics team at Google went. I'm sure there's shady behind-the-scenes crap, because there always is at large companies. But even if Amazon really is secretly recording your house 24/7 and keeping the audio (which again, they lost likely aren't) it's a massive, massive leap from 'FAANG companies secretly storing audio clips internally' to ""the courts will now admit illegally collected/t&amp;c-violating audio from Alexa units to create complex ML models designed to provide corroborative character evidence in DV trials, which will definitely be believed by a jury and not get torn to shreds by opposing counsel"". The only cases that I've ever seen where Alexa/GH evidence was even introduced in court to date, after years of this tech existing, was brief audio clips resulting from mistaken activations (""hey you"" being misinterpreted ad ""hey Google"" etc). GoogleHome and Alexa aren't going to magically start sending live audio from your home 24/7 to cops to build personality assessments, because customers would completely lose their shit if they did. It would be the worst possible business decision that Amazon could ever make, and the one and only thing that talks at Amazon is money. And if they already are covertly doing so, it's certainly never been shown yet in publicly documented court cases where subpoenas for Alexa data already has been provided… all they've gotten are brief blips of incidental audio after triggerphrases, that corroborated pre-established material facts in the case. Moreover, we've even seen that FAANG companies aren't always forthcoming when they DO possibly have relevant data, like in the San Bernardino iPhone debacle. So unless you're saying the govt is going to introduce their own recording devices into everyone's homes to listen 24/7, in order to build their own elaborate machine learning models about everyones behaviour to use in court... I'm not even sure where the audio data you're referencing would come from. There are business, technical, and legal reasons why 24/7 surveillance via smart devices being used to build character models as admissible legal evidence is massively dubious and wildly unlikely in the foreseeable future

It just seems like overall you're asserting that as soon as new AI technology comes out, the judicial system will just hand over the keys to the house and legislation will be automatically drafted that empowers it. If anything, nearly all modern AI legislation I'm aware of is RESTRICTING its use, particularly in legal settings, not empowering it.

I'm not saying that there aren't risks with rapidly advancing ML. I'm also DEFINITELY not saying there aren't legal consequences of AI that are potentially huge - I myself cited Clearview and recidivism prediction algorithms as huge, huge examples of this. I'm just saying that making claims like ""we're going to make new laws that make it illegal to not use Google maps"" or ""Alexa will take the stand in court, show an ML model based on years of covertly collected audio that claims that a victim of DV is crazy, and the court will universally trust it as unfalsifiable evidence"" are flights of fancy that detract from the real threats we face.

 Experts in a dangerous field where there are huge risks (like ours) should be sharing the *real* risks, not hyperbolic assumptions of what theoretically could happen in a fucked-up dystopia. I'm not disagreeing with you that AI ethics and law are a huge, huge, huge issue. I'm certainly not disagreeing that if we're not *much* more careful than we are as an industry today, some truly horrific unknown-unknowns WILL inevitably show up. As a fellow ML practitioner, trust me, I get it, I really do. I'm purely disagreeing with you because it feels like you're using your position of authority as a self-described expert in our field to make easily falsifiable strawman arguments that aren't based on real threats, and therefore doing nothing except for creating distrust in laypeople of a tech field that also still stands to do tons of good. As industry professionals, it's critical that we communicate about the REAL risks, not imagined ones (and yes there's lots of them). We need to tell people about the very real threats of less glamorous but highly harmful things, like mortgage/loan approvals based on shoddy and biased predictive algorithms, or flawed self-driving car systems. But equally importantly, we need to avoid stoking an already burning inferno of general distrust of our field with scifi fantasies of dystopias that will almost certainly never come to be",1619038415.0,1

"It's called digital tenancy. Biggest reason is the misunderstanding of ""ownership"". When you purchase something from Apple (or any other online item) you are not purchasing the item, you are purchasing the rights to use the item within the Terms of Service for the various services. There is no ""ownership"" to have. This has led to the subscription model for software (adobe suite, for example) where you don't own the software, you buy the right to use the software while you have a valid subscription.

The issue of ""ownership"" has been brought up a lot, especially every time one of these stores pops up. This isn't the first time this happened, and every single time these lawsuits come up the companies just get even better at tailoring and locking down their business model.

In the end, I would bet Apple is pretty much indifferent to access to the various products that were paid for -- but the rules are set by the ""makers"". If Apple wants to sell movies they have to do what the studios want. Same with music. That's just how things go.

So yes, they are still connected to the grid and running off fossil fuels henceforth. 60% is pretty decent on renewables, all are heavily investing in renewable infra and heavily invested in RECs.

&gt;Do you believe a smart grid, full of all different types of free energy production is even feasible for our society. To run the world? Can we even get there? And is it in-fact the answer. Or will we just destroy and pollute the environment in the same fashion but under a new label?

Efficient usage, production and consumption are an absolute must along with investing in nuclear. Anything that can smooth the irregular production aspects of renewables is massively beneficial.

Anything which can help match supply with demand is also a must.

In lieu of advances in battery/power storage tech, there must be a smart grid capable of adjusting demand for productive purposes or for storage.",1619202816.0,1
"Yup, but a place with infrastructure and human settlements like Florida is better than a patch of cleared rainforest in the Guianas. 

The ESA have to ship all their rockets there by boat as well, and it's probably the least suited place on the planet to build a rocket factory as there's practically no infrastructure in the region, and it's nearly completely isolated from the rest of the world because of the Guiana Shield.

If you're in Kourou you got two ways connecting you to the rest of the world: Cross Suriname and Guyana, then drive through the rainforest to Boa Vista in Brazil (I've done that trip, but starting in Boa Vista -- and most of it is on dirt roads) - Or continue down south to Macapá from where you hit another dead end, and have to cross the Amazon River by boat (I went from Kourou to Cayanne and on to Macapá before flying to Rio)

And I'm guessing Fortaleza (Brazil) is to far south to make sense as a launch site, Venezuela is out of the question because of Trinidad &amp; Tobago, and then we're back up to Florida to avoid Caribbean islands.

"MacKenzie Scott Gave Away Billions. The Scam Artists Followed.

She has no large foundation, headquarters or public website. That makes it easier to dispense money on her own terms — and for others to prey on the vulnerable in her name.

Credit...Chris Koehler

By Nicholas Kulish

April 24, 2021

Danielle Churchill needed help. She was raising five children in Wollongong, on the Australian coast south of Sydney, and had to cover thousands of dollars in special therapy fees for her 10-year-old son, Lachlan, who has autism. She tried crowdfunding on the site GoFundMe, but raised just a tiny fraction of what she had hoped for.

Late last year, she received the message that seemed to solve her financial problems. It was purportedly an email from the billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, a novelist best known as the ex-wife of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, saying that she was giving away half her fortune and that Ms. Churchill had qualified for a grant.

Ms. Churchill searched Google for Ms. Scott’s name and the word “scam.” Instead of warnings, she found numerous news articles describing how Ms. Scott’s representatives had emailed hundreds of nonprofit groups out of the blue with offers of monetary support.

“People were thinking they were scams, but then they came true,” Ms. Churchill, 34, recalled thinking.

Over the course of 2020, Ms. Scott announced gifts totaling nearly $6 billion. Her unconventional model of giving was widely praised for its speed and directness. But some of the seeming advantages — no large, established foundation, headquarters, public website or indeed any way to reach her or her representatives — are exactly what made her ripe for impersonation by scammers, as Ms. Churchill would soon find out.

To receive the money, Ms. Churchill had to fill out a “membership form” sent by an organization calling itself the MacKenzie Scott Foundation and set up an online account with Investors Bank and Trust Company. She could see that the foundation had transferred $250,000 into the account in her name, but because she was in Australia, she was told that she had to apply for a tax number and pay some associated fees before she could get access to the money and begin spending it on speech and occupational therapy for Lachlan.

“I was doing my research, looking up everything they were telling me,” Ms. Churchill said. She added that her grandmother had looked things over and thought it was legitimate. “Everything you ask, they send you proof. The online bank says everything is secure.”

What Ms. Churchill did not know was that there is no MacKenzie Scott Foundation. The Investors Bank and Trust Company, once based in Boston, had been folded into State Street Corporation more than a decade ago. And Ms. Churchill was not dealing with Ms. Scott and her team but a sophisticated group of scammers adept at preying on vulnerable people.

In Ms. Churchill’s case, the scam involved not just the fake bank portal but counterfeit Facebook pages, WhatsApp messages and the use of a Bitcoin cryptocurrency app to whisk the money away, roughly $7,900 American dollars in all, so she could not reclaim it with the help of a bank or credit-card company.

An email-security company in Israel, Ironscales, said messages purporting to be from representatives for Ms. Scott had targeted roughly 190,000 email accounts belonging to its customers. The company began seeing the scam after Ms. Scott’s announcement on Dec. 15 of nearly $4.2 billion in donations.

Now, months after she set up an account at a bank that does not exist, Ms. Churchill is aware of other apparent victims. She continued to watch the Facebook pages purporting to belong to Ms. Scott, and would notice people asking for help in the comments. Then the comments would disappear. One man posted photographs of his debit card. “Snap its back and front and the location of the bank,” read the instructions next to a smiling photo of Ms. Scott.

And on Ms. Scott’s Medium post from December announcing her latest grants, one man posted a comment asking about the same supposed business manager who solicited funds from Ms. Churchill.

Marti DeLiema, a professor at the School of Social Work at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, said the method that Ms. Scott used, notifying groups of a grant essentially out of the blue, was ripe for scammers to exploit.

“What a gift she’s given them by this crazy way of giving that she’s developed,” Professor DeLiema said.

Even people with Ms. Scott’s resources can’t prevent swindlers from using their names. Scammers have copied the webpage of the federal Small Business Administration and impersonated the Federal Trade Commission, one of the agencies trying to combat exactly these sorts of cons.

Ms. Scott gives to institutions — universities, food banks, other frontline charities — not individuals. She has no accounts on social media like Facebook and Instagram, only her Medium page and a verified Twitter account with just three tweets. Her organization would never request fees upfront from grant recipients, a person with knowledge of her giving said. The person declined to comment directly on online deception taking place in Ms. Scott’s name or what actions she might take to help prevent it.

Ms. Churchill did more research and realized it was highly unlikely that Ms. Scott had been in touch with her directly, but still she could not cut herself off from the scammers right away. She had invested everything she could pull together in unlocking those promised funds.",1619337710.0,1

If anything the $15 move was a way to make sure the brand wouldn’t be damaged by the constant negative press around working conditions in the warehouses (which were and still are valid criticisms, but the fact is Amazon still has one of the best brands among US consumers thanks to moves like this), plus having no issues hiring to meet their demand with associated costs of turnover (training, recruiting).

If you're already a depressed peon here on earth that ain't gonna change on Mars. You'll just be an even easier target for the wealthy capitalists that will be running it to con into being a slave because you're already willing to take the chance.  

The government situation there will be _terrible_. You'll have the egomaniacal billionaires here on earth basically being literal gods there because it's all that's left for them. They've already won the game here. Musk has already said he will bankroll the cost to send people, but those people will be required to work for him in return. 

&gt;Musk might choose to go all God-Emperor and declare that he owns the water and air machines (and strictly speaking, he probably would own them) but whoever has direct physical access to the machines is the one that controls them. If a group decides to try and take over, they run into the simultaneous advantage/disadvantage that at any time a small grouping of colonists could just destroy enough of the distribution system to kill everyone. It can be Musk's or Space-Hitler's enforcers there guarding the machines, but that won't do them a fat lot of good if a small enough group is willing to just start cutting open pipes or slashing power cables.

No. They'd just kill people. Shoot one mother fucker in the head in front of the rest, and they **will** fall in line. People in general are dumb and weak. It's been the case throughout all of human history. Hell, shoot 2 people in the head and 70% of the others will immediately turn rat and foil any small uprising.

What an absurd statement. You are not going to send over untrained explorers. And explorers will realize they will have to live to a different standard when they get there.

You continue to act as if colonists go first. Pioneers go before them and explorers before them. It may be difficult to send explorers to Mars first and not pioneers due to the inhospitableness of Mars. But does not that alone underscore my point?

Explorers in the new world foraged and hunted to keep alive. They lived off the land. They may have had trouble because they weren't sure exactly what they could eat in the New World. But comparing that to Mars we see that we do know exactly what on Mars explorers can eat. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. We know it is harder, much, much harder than the New World.

We can't even support Antarctic or ISS pioneers/explorers without bringing supplies from Earth (temperate Earth in the case of Antarctica). And we can resupply each of those must easier than we can supply Mars. There is only an efficient transfer window to or from Mars every 2.5 years (ish). And even in the efficient transfer windows the costs of bringing materials from Earth is so high it's impossible to justify a Mars base/forward base supplied that way.",1619419006.0,1

"An AI would only want to maximize productivity if that’s what it was programmed to do. In reality it would be programmed to maximize *profits*, the main driving goal of any public corporation, and that has almost nothing to do with productivity.

Look at Amazon, I’ve lost count of how many packages I’ve had to return because they were damaged in shipping, and I hear the same thing from others all the time. This year alone they’ve probably lost like $40 on me from having to re-send packages. You’d think “wow, if they worked on improving productivity so that workers did a better job packing and delivering that’s a bunch of money to be saved”, but in reality they just pay extremely low wages and have high turnover when employees inevitably get burned out. They have zero interest in productive, happy employees, what they want is a cheap workforce, full stop.

Amazon has determined that terrible service with huge amounts of loss due to inefficiency is way more profitable than good, efficient service in the first place because the overall costs are so much lower.

**While the US leads in tech, Brussels is setting the standards for online privacy and regulating AI**

The Americans innovate and the Europeans regulate. That was a simple way of explaining the interaction between government and the technology business. It is still broadly true. The European Union is not quite an innovation desert but nothing rivals Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook or Microsoft. The US has flubbed questions such as internet privacy, whereas the EU is a rule-making superpower. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of 2018 has become, in effect, a global standard.

Now the EU is flexing its muscles again, issuing proposed regulations on the hottest topic in digital governance: artificial intelligence, or AI. That is well overdue. Computer decision-making can determine whether you get a job, a loan, a home or a date, as well as what news or ads appear on your screen. The software that makes these decisions is almost impenetrable. It is “trained” on databases that may have serious flaws. If computers learn to make decisions based on information about young white men, say, they may botch choices involving women, older people or those with different skin colour.

Proposals for ethical AI abound but so far only the EU is trying to codify in law principles such as fairness and transparency. The result is far from perfect. Its 100-page white paper is replete with exceptions. A few things are banned outright, such as what it calls “subliminal” manipulation of individual decision-making. Facial recognition is tightly regulated (finding missing children is fine; Chinese-style population surveillance isn’t). Penalties are hefty: up to 6 per cent of a violator’s global revenues.

Lobbying over the details in the coming years will be intense. All that time and energy will underline the EU’s importance as the global rule-setter. It will also highlight the costs of the legislative vacuum in Washington. When American lawmakers decided ten years ago that internet privacy was none of their business, they in effect handed power to Brussels. They may not make that mistake again but Marietje Schaake, a former Dutch MEP now at Stanford University, argues neither the EU’s top-down regulation nor the US’s corporate-focused model are enough.",1619461059.0,1

"I'm not arguing that AI *can't* result in more ethical business decisions. That discussion is probably a little too deep into the realm of theoretical debate for me to meaningfully take part.

I think there's probably a strong argument to be made that AI, even operating in our existing framework of economics, could make much better decisions if it was designed to value longevity. You are correct in pointing out that it's possible for corporations to thrive when their labor force is happy and well-compensated, so perhaps a corporation's leadership would choose to put such an AI in place. However, there are plenty of examples to demonstrate that treating the workforce as expendable and pushing them too far can be (and perhaps always will be) even more profitable (Amazon being the obvious case there). Ultimately, the decision on if and how to implement an AI system would be in the hands of the very people who regularly abuse our existing system for their own self-enrichment.

What it comes down to for me is *who* designs that system and what it learns or is taught to value. If it were *me* making the decision, I would want an AI that values the long-term prosperity and wellbeing of the company's laborers, including after retirement. I would expect this theoretical AI to make good business decisions in the pursuit of those values, but the profitability of the company would only be prioritized insofar as it serves the overall mission of taking care of its people.

My concern in this debate is that most people making that decision would not share those priorities, because one of the most consistent traits of capitalist economics is valuing short term gain over long term sustainability. Maybe there will come a time when our cultural values overwhelmingly shift enough for that to change, but I have little faith in that happening even in time to prevent the worst effects of climate change.",1619472891.0,1

"Amazon didn't really innovate much though. All the tech that Amazon is championing is in use in non-Amazon warehouses, couriers, and supply chains. What they innovated was the investment model. And that investment model is to never have any revenue so that you don't pay taxes. Then take more investment money to buy more stuff but because you're buying stuff without making a profit you make a loss you don't pay taxes. Even though you're dependent on the roads that taxes pay for, the healthcare that taxes pay for, the education taxes pay for. 

Because to Amazon if they pay 30% in corporation taxes then to them they get nothing in return. If they spend all their revenue buying up robot tech and automated supermarket technology. Then they can sell those assets on at a later date - potentially at a mark up. Which is not true of their taxes.

Social media and modern technology companies tend to create their own incumbent barriers to stop competition. Most of them are either based on features or algorithms, but a lot of them are simply driven by user habits. Once a service gets a mature userbase in a niche it's an incredibly expensive proposition to replicate it and compete. First mover advantage and network effect have made companies like amazon and facebook natural monopolies.

Can I create my own service to compete with facebook? Sure. Will I ever be able to create one that's as integrated and has the userbase without a trillion dollars? Probably not. Even if I tried, they would use monopolistic behavior and further investment to make it harder for me to compete. 

The thing to think about here is that companies like standard oil grew due to their ability to take public goods and leverage them with other natural monopolies in order to grow and lock out the market. They had access to the legal system and central banking (public goods) and used other natural monopolies (canals, railroads and telegraphs) in order to aggregate information and first chase horizontal then vertical integration of their product stream. 

Standard oil buys magnolia, facebook buys instagram. Standard oil builds a price index of the national market via telegram, facebook builds beacon to track user browsing off their site. The situations don't exactly line up but there are enough similarities that we need to examine regulation.

&gt;Most of them are either based on features or algorithms, but a lot of them are simply driven by user habits. Once a service gets a mature userbase in a niche it's an incredibly expensive proposition to replicate it and compete.

Or are we going to pretend that myspace, mcdonald's, and jcpenney's are the juggernauts they once were?

&gt;First mover advantage and network effect have made companies like amazon and facebook natural monopolies.

Objectively false, a natural monopoly occurs based around limited resources, internet bandwidth and the human proclivity for useful entertainment and luxuries are arguably limitless. Amazon competes with apple, google, facebook, ebay, walmart, kmart, publix, giant, walgreens, home depot etc. Etc. Etc. Etc. They are nowhere near a monopoly. Facebook has a similar list of competitors, it competes with your phone company, texting, reddit, snapchat, line, weebo,  movies, games etc. It's an entertainment luxury and again, it's a social media site, they can easily go the way of myspace if someone else designs something better, which honestly looks like it's coming in the next 10 years since facebook is getting more and more stale.

&gt;Can I create my own service to compete with facebook? Sure. Will I ever be able to create one that's as integrated and has the userbase without a trillion dollars? Probably not. 
Facebook destroyed myspace, a multi-billion dollar social media website with first mover advantage and the network effect without spending trillions. Why wouldn't yours do the same? 

&gt;Even if I tried, they would use monopolistic behavior and further investment to make it harder for me to compete. 

How? There's plenty of competitors that started after facebook that have plenty of skin in the game.

Yes

&gt;facebook buys instagram. Standard oil builds a price index of the national market via telegram, facebook builds beacon to track user browsing off their site. The situations don't exactly line up but there are enough similarities that we need to examine regulation

Heavily disagree, comparing an inherently limited resource like oil to a nearly infinite resource like bandwidth and users is just completely unreasonable and betrays an ignorance to the stark fundamental differences therein between the two markets. You can't power a car, plane, or train economically with anything other than oil, humanity *needs* oil, it's irreplaceable in many applications. 
Facebook? Facebook provides entertainment and a communication medium, you don't *need* facebook to be entertained, facebook isn't stopping people from being able to thoroughly enjoy other forms media. The comparison is just completely unreasonable

"&gt;You can’t have a monopoly over your own products and App Store.

The App Store is very similar to Amazon. They are both platforms which third party sellers and developers use as storefronts to sell their product. The App Store has strict guidelines for what apps are allowed to use their storefront. This is not inherently wrong.

But, there is a little talked about fact regarding these huge storefront platforms. Amazon, and, by extension, the App Store, are not technically monopolies. They are, however, monopsonies. They don't want to control the production of a product, they want to control the purchase of said product. 

They become monopsonies by trying to become the only storefront for sellers to use. Apple has already achieved this and Amazon is close to achieving it if they haven't already. This is similar to Walmart overtaking all other retail outlets and becoming the only market where producers can sell their products.

This means two things:

1. Unlimited bargaining power over producers.
2. If Walmart/Amazon/The App Store collapses, there will be no way for producers to sell their products to consumers unless they make their own infrastructure.

"You are way WAY too far out in left field with Hollywood. AI... is not that. I don't really know how to help you understand that other than show you things like [AI Flying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwH9m5rPJlc) [AI Driving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V7-5wLsnYk) &amp; so on. You're missing a very fundamental concept here... AI isn't going to 'replace' mankind or become some apex predator terminator bullshit like 'YOU' think it is. No one's designing self learning software based on extinction... that's a fundamental waste of time &amp; if you don't 'grasp' that... then you're apart of the problem that I'm talking about. 

The points of reference here for judicial oversight are in matters like the free market autonomy &amp; 3rd world nations being unable to even join the world table once we have that machine capability. The concept here is that once learning becomes exponentially more able than an individual human being it is that way forever &amp; it's that way really in whatever it's designed as. You put up parameters here on things like Enyx has with ai drone flight simulations &amp; what you see post singularity is an individual company comes up with this idea. Feeds it into that base singularity ai, &amp; then suddenly it can't be beaten. What do you think the implications on the free market are? 

See what 'I'M' talking about? You end up with individual sectors of the economy that one by one go out like lights on a christmas tree to which there is no further expansion of concept or ability by anyone, even a machine beyond the original who's got the ability to exponentially learn from itself &amp; everything around it in it's parametered discipline. This looks like Amazon making it first to drone delivery autonomy &amp; then suddenly... no one else is ever going to be able to design a subset or system that is superior to Amazon's...

Yes Singularity is a big deal, the reason it's a big deal to people like me is the recognition that sovereignty lines &amp; governments are being eroded by interdisciplinary stagnation of different economic sectors on purpose to perpetuate founders net worth rather than monetize adaptation &amp; growth in new technologies.

&gt;They are in the business of collecting and selling data first and foremost.

This is one thing I take particular issue with people putting as with most businesses (even more so with this size) are really just in the business of making money, how they do that can differ radically between products and sections. Different branches of MS and Amazon have radically different ways they go about monetization to best fit their product and a company branching out like Facebook is no different. While no doubt Facebook prime business influences others it does not mean it will be the same business model used.

As for data collection the extent of the data that would be actually profitable for them is simply the games that you play and even that is only valued because they are getting into selling software and way more on getting more games it's users would play on their store. Utilizing the cameras and mic on it to get additional user data is essentially unprofitable/pointless for them which leads into the other issue I have with people's wide spread claims on this, and this is coming from someone who dislikes and doesn't use facebook.

Again as a business they ultimately care about profit, yes at some points revenue first during the growth stage but still ultimately profit. Going about and collecting images and audio from tons of devices to analyze is very expensive and costly for something that simply getting GPS and cross referencing neighborhood data would get you 99+% of the same critical information advertisers care about how users live while consuming drastically less resources. Yes there can be blips like a millionaire living in a run down apartment, but those are more exceptions than the general rule.

This IS NOT to dismiss privacy concerns but more that people drastically overthink them and not realize how a lot of information can be squeezed out of very basic stuff and skim over them.

"So, hyperbole aside, let's traverse this rabbit hole.

The ""analytics data"" being collected isn't to help them ""improve their product"", unless by ""product"" you mean you, the user. 

The analytics data they collect is literally any I/O that goes through the headset. Its digesting anything that comes over that microphone too. The data harvesting they're doing is often sought, not just by advertising, but also by law enforcement, and all of this represents a disgusting loophole in the 4th amendment.

In the FB utopia this means they can better target advertising to you, knowing they're narrowing the numbers game. Advertisers see a ripe market, Facebook sees dollar signs. But Law Enforcement sees, ""oh FB can get access to much of what goes on in your home without a warrant, great, let's see what you've been up to.""

I used to be pretty ambivalent about fb data collection. When I realized just how far its reach and just how pervasive, I became much more concerned. And it's not like I'm running a trap house or something, I just am not inviting FB to live in my home rent free. Or Google, or Amazon. Or the State.

This stuff is surveillance. It's advertised as ""improve product"" or ""convenience"", but it's your privacy and you have no say in who gets it. You give that away with your ToS.


Sidestepping the ""nothing to hide"" argument, this sort of dynamic leads to a future where warrants are sought less. Less warrants mean less judicial oversight, means authoritarian scope creep. Everyone should enjoy the protection of judicial review when the State take an interest in them.

"&gt;Uber is deciding who gets the job. Customers can't pick the driver they like best. Their choices are which ever driver gets assigned to them, or no ride at all. Drivers have no real ability to pick their customers (They have very limited ability to reject rides, but nothing like what exists in a free market). I can pick whoever I want to clean my house, limited only by however many people offer, and cleaners can be as picky as they like in what jobs they take.

This is done for simplicity sake. also i think the job goes to however is the closest (again, for best customer and driver experience). if the job goes to everyone, and someone 40mins away accepts the job...not many customers would come back.

Go look at how the ""free market"" was during non-uber days where you would have to call a dispatch and *maybe* some taxi would come.

There is no real way of a customer looking up Bob Smith Transport if they ever want to use their services again either. 

But you can...you can see your driver and your rating before getting into the uber. and cancel if you dont like the driver.

&gt;Similarly, Uber drivers don't think of themselves as taking on a bunch of different one off jobs, they think of themselves as providing a service for Uber. 
what uber drivers think of themselves is not and should not be any metric to go by. If i think of myself as a CEO of the company...doesnt mean I am.

&gt;Uber takes care of all of the customer service. They do the pre-sale service. They process the money. They do any after service needed. If a customer has a complaint, they can't complain directly to their driver, they complain to Uber. Uber decides the outcome of the complaint.

**Accelerating revenue and profits suggest an enduring effect from shift to digital during pandemic**

After the world’s largest tech companies enjoyed a boom during the coronavirus pandemic, the expectation was that life would gradually return to normal.

It certainly is not turning out that way.

Big Tech this week reported a surge in growth and profits that stunned Wall Street, delivering powerful evidence that the digital dependence forced on a large part of the world’s population over the past year could have an enduring effect.

The outsized figures amount to a reset in the business world, some tech investors and analysts said. According to this view, the leading digital powers have consolidated their gains from the past 12 months and made themselves an even more indispensable part of work and personal life.

“It’s been an unbelievable tech reporting season for the biggest of the big,” said Jim Tierney, a fund manager at AllianceBernstein.

Big Tech’s increasingly outsized impact on the world of business can best be summed up by just two numbers.

One is the combined revenue of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft, which jumped 41 per cent in the first three months of this year, to $322bn. That points to a rapid acceleration in growth that the leading tech companies have not seen in years, even as they have become some of the world’s biggest companies.

The other is the companies’ profit growth, which has been even more spectacular. After-tax earnings for the five soared by 105 per cent from the previous year, to $75bn. Profit margins rose strongly across the sector, as the biggest companies benefited from the economics of scale while keeping a wary eye on cost expansion during the pandemic.",1619798370.0,1
"[3]

The stellar first-quarter performance can be traced clearly in a handful of areas. Digital advertising, which has been making steady inroads into traditional forms of commercial messaging for years, has jumped sharply.

The most widely-used mobile and cloud computing platforms, from the iPhone to Amazon’s cloud services, have seen a new burst of activity. And some leading tech companies have capitalised on the extensive use of their platforms to mount an incursion into a wider range of highly profitable services.

“Pre-pandemic, we were seeing a deceleration in digital advertising growth — but the pandemic has juggled a lot of things,” said Wieser. Brand owners developed a new appreciation of digital advertising during the pandemic as they became more reliant on online sales, he added, while the many new businesses formed over the past year have turned naturally to online channels to find a market.

Google and Facebook each registered their strongest advertising growth for years, with Google’s ad revenue increasing 32 per cent and Facebook’s leaping 46 per cent. The leaps come against a recovering backdrop for global advertising markets — though they far outpace the 10 per cent rebound expected for the industry at large this year, according to GroupM.

The time and money consumers are now willing to lavish on their most important gadgets, meanwhile, was seen in a 66 per cent leap in Apple’s revenue from the sale of iPhones. Even the market for PCs, which had been in decline, saw a strong rebound, with unit sales leaping by around a third in the first quarter, raising earnings at Microsoft.

By comparison, the steady expansion of the cloud computing platforms run by Amazon, Microsoft and Google, which have become a mainstay of corporate IT departments, have made fewer headlines. But the rise of remote work, learning and entertainment enabled all three cloud operators to maintain the growth rates they were recording this time last year — even as they become much larger, and as some of their customers were hard hit during the pandemic.",1619798439.0,1
"[4]

Meanwhile, the tech companies have taken advantage of their deep ties with millions of users to extend their reach deeper into some of the services delivered over their platforms. Apple’s move into services, once disdained by Wall Street as an uninteresting sideline to its gadgets, contributed to a profit jump that lifted its gross profit margin to more than 42 per cent — a breakout from the level of around 38 per cent that had held over many quarters.

At Amazon, meanwhile, newer services have brought a transformation in the company’s profit profile. That includes the growth of the Amazon Web Services cloud platform, as well as advertising — as seen in a 73 per cent leap in the company’s “other revenue” category, which consists mainly of ads, in the first quarter.

The result was a record quarterly profit for a company once notorious for its persistent losses. Amazon’s $8.1bn in after-tax earnings in the quarter was equivalent to the company’s net earnings in its entire first 22 years of existence.

Amid the euphoria on Wall Street, concerns about potential intervention by regulators to curb the power — and profits — of Big Tech were briefly forgotten. Shares in all but Apple were at or very close to all-time highs in the wake of the latest figures.

There were few other worries to spoil the party. An end to the strong secular growth trends that have lifted Big Tech could loom before too many years, said Tierney. But he added: “How many years can Microsoft grow 50 per cent in the cloud business, and how many years can Google’s advertising keep growing at 30 per cent? There’s no sign of them hitting the wall yet.”",1619798476.0,1
"I really like working from home. Saves me hours of commute time, the housing is cheaper and I put in longer hours of work (because I want to) resulting in higher individual productivity. I strongly recognize the benefits of working from home over commute to office. However, my organization noticed that while working from home has upped individual productivity, it is decimating group productivity of high performing, loosely coupled teams. Minimal impact to teams with highly structured processes. Does this means that the loosely coupled teams should move to highly structured processes to reduce impact? We tried that and it only exacerbated the problem. That is because high performing individuals struggle to perform at their peak performance in rigid process structures. Assuming those at Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, etc are generally considered high performance individuals, I can see how the working from home culture might have affected group performance. 

These companies mostly make data oriented decisions. Google, like my org, must have noticed the performance numbers change for the worse for these high performance teams. I am not a fan of long commutes or exorbitant home prices but the data is starting to show deterioration in group performance and interpersonal relationships due to remote working. If you’ve noticed people have got edgier at work, lot of it is due to the raging pandemic that is tearing families apart. A small portion of it is due to lack of face-to-face communication. Video calls aren’t cutting it.",1619798969.0,-1

For software developers, that's like... $140k vs $150-160k at other FAANGs/big tech at entry level in the Bay Area. Big tech usually treats its employees well (some exceptions like Amazon) and pays well. They spend a lot of money on perks but that's because if they don't, it affects employee retention/their competition has it and will steal their employees. 

Startups, on the other hand, are a different story and might use the perks to pay lower.",1619801322.0,1

In the bay area, the companies start up there because the pool of talent they need is already all there. And the way it works now is that people can make up to 20%+ more income by switch jobs every two years vs staying anywhere for longer.

And the same things would just keep happening. If the Amazon HQ moved to middle of nowhere town, new tech startups would start forming nearby because anyone who doesn't want to work at Amazon would be the new pool, and you'd slowly build up another tech hub town anyway.

It all's all down to how housing policy is handled in states and nationally. With little regulation on cost/rent, and restrictions on building new housing in many of these places (SF especially), it leads to these huge incentives to keep raising prices. It doesn't really have much to do per se with high wages. The wages increase to match the cost of living, not the other way around.",1619804519.0,0

"I'm gonna play on Google's side on this one, as well as the other big techs. So, the reason their salaries are so extremely high is to pay for extremely high San Francisco cost of living + taxes while still trying to pay a competitive total compensation. That being said, being able to move out to somewhere significantly cheaper doesn't really justify these companies' compensation scaled for the high cost of living.

Not only that, but these companies invest heavily in what they call ""micro-interactions,"" many of the genuinely great ideas that have come out of Google, Amazon, and the other companies have come from people just bumping into people they wouldn't normally speak with in the office. The way their offices are designed are to trigger these kinds of random interactions between employees. 

Yes, commuting sucks, but office spaces actually hold real value and are worth working in. If you hate going to work so much, get a different job. There are plenty of actual remote jobs for software devs out there that pay according to the fact that you could literally be living anywhere in the country/world rather than paying to cover astronomical costs of living.
