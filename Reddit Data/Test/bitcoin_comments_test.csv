"&gt; Did corporations determine who won the U.S. election? No, the relevant officials did. And they are the ones who, by your own words, ”determine the truth” in this case.

I'm obviously not making my point clear. You suggested an independent fact checker to determine truth/misinformation rather than a government body - but now you're saying leave it to the official government body. My point is, no matter who you go with, it is handing them far too much power. Being able to say, ""That post is misinformation and that person needs to be jailed"" is just ripe for corruption.     

&gt;So you go on a case-by-case basis. Do vaccines cause autism? Ask the scientific community. They say no. Then that’s the truth.

How does the scientific community collaborate and review anything if a dissenting opinion can be construed as illegal and a jailable offence? How can they, or anyone wanting to keep something secret (for patent reasons for example), collaborate if there are no 'walled gardens', no encryption and everything is to be out in the open? Why spend billions researching something when you can just read the posts of some other country and steal their data/ideas.

&gt;To identify the people who post disinformation and hold them accountable.

So since you brought up Trump and the US, does than mean all those people that Trump claimed are spreading 'Fake News' should be jailed now? He was taken to court and tried for impeachment, and won. Do all those calling him a criminal and saying he should lose the presidency go to jail, as they're obviously spreading misinformation according to the courts.

As an aside, the above is hyperbole. Trump is an arrogant criminal wannabe dictator - but his powers could possibly mean sending people to jail for 'spreading misinformation' under your theory.

I wouldn't short it, though.

"Pure EV? Not a ton, I think Nissan hit around the 100k mark and is relatively new to the market. Toyotas focus is HEVs. When it comes to HEVs they've outsold Tesla. 

The elephant in the room that nobody has an answer for is how does Tesla keep its supercharger network at the same pace as car sells. The competition has outpaced Tesla in deployment. Even if the grid can keep up with the needs of EVs Teslas monopoly is in danger with networks like Chargestation. 

Let's not forget the real world performance of the V3 superchargers and the hype that hasn't been delivered.

We had planned to get a Model X and had the opportunity to test drive one for a few days. The autopilot is about as good as a honda, the build quality was awful compared to our A8 we owned, and it was quiet. The final nail in the coffin was waiting over an hour to charge the thing, first you wait in line if its busy for 40+ minutes, after that you wait another hour to get a partial charge.

It's a neat car, but it's still a novelty like it or not. If you dont ever plan to make a trip during a holiday in it and you dont mind waiting in long lines its cool. 

We still very well may get a model 3 for an around town grocery getter just to not have the maintenance costs etc associated with an ICE car.

Once the Porsche Taycan and others like it hit the secondary market and arent ""cool"" anymore like the panamera did, I feel Tesla is going to have some issues competing when you'll be able to pick up a luxury EV that has a bigger charge network for 50-60k and is leaps and bounds ahead of Tesla on quality.

Want a self driving car that fills up in a minute or two and can get 400+ miles and can use electric power and affordable? Buy a used honda accord HEV and a comma two from comma.ai . Can do be done for just over $16k.

Just my opinion, and hey I could be wrong. I sold 1,000s of shares of NIO this year at around $2 in March. And who knows how much Bitcoin when it was pennies back before you could do anything with it outside of selling it on ebay. So I've been wrong plenty before lol.",1609717749.0,1

"Sorry I thought you were talking about crypto as a whole not just bitcoin. 

Bitcoin's main use is currently as an asset. It's useful because there are enough people on board with the idea and typically you hold it like you would an asset. You don't use it to buy pizza because transactions are validated with proof of work, and long story short this is very expensive.

Ethereum on the other hand is moving to a new network soon called proof of stake, and this would behave much more like your traditional currency. The difference between ethereum and bitcoin is the ability for the ethereum network to validate a greater number of transactions per second at a far lower cost. The transactions per second are still lower than visa/mastercard which is 88k per second or something (You could look this up pretty easily), but the idea is that you could scale this up in the future. The network is beta testing still so there are bugs, not much point in scaling up until you have it working.

Bitcoin - Asset/Currency (much like gold coins used to be) &amp; Ethereum - Currency you could order a pizza with. 

Technology evolves and people fix problems. The problems with existing currency are driving wealth inequality (tax evasion) or geopolitical struggles (historically petro$ but also currency manipulation in the yuan). It's possible cryptocurrencies fix these problems as regulations are part of the network operations and transactions are immutable on a public ledger.

I mentioned those two crypto chains because they are far and away the dominant players but like I said, it might be a new chain that really takes off and becomes mass adopted.

It's very difficult to speculate on regular currencies and generally not a smart way to invest money. George Soros and Keynes were successful but I have a feeling they were more or less outliers. It's very risky to try to make money from currency markets.",1609822303.0,1

"Not o.p but one of the arguments for blockchain is the 'security' of digital assets. If you have 15% of your wealth in gold as risk minimisation then where do you store the gold?

As is having it in a safety deposit box should you want to skip country or liquidate it quickly and securely. So that's one reason Bitcoin is pretty cool, you just need to remember your wallet passphrase off by heart and you can access your wallet from anywhere in the world. 

Commodities markets are a different investment class from currency markets. But these markets are greatly affected by domestic and regional economic factors and as such are good investments for growth but have less security.

Governments are not ""debasing"" currencies, their independent central banks create money supply to match the expansion of the economy plus a small but positive inflation. Positive inflation is important so that the money keeps circulating instead of being indefinitely stored in bank accounts.

Bitcoin is inherently deflationary because the monetary policy is encoded into an algorithm and the total supply of bitcoins is fixed. As a result, it is completely unsuitable for use as a currency. It is purely a speculation vehicle.

"The mining is the process that takes all the energy because they are guessing for 10 minutes to what the solution is. They need to figure out a hash that starts with a certain number of zeros.

So if a group were to get control of 50% of the miners. What they would have a 50% chance to deny certain transactions. But all the addresses are just public keys and they don't know who they belong to, and they absolutely can't change balances. The only thing they can do is censor a transaction. Which risks ruining the ecosystem, all there money and equipment is useless if that happens. They are kept in line with game theory. It simply isn't profitable to do something that.

As for a quantum break through on mining, if that happens, the difficulty of the network adjusts to regulate the creation of bitcoins every 10 minutes. So if some new break through happens, the landscape becomes more competitive for that Coinbase reward( the reward for mining a block). The end result is a more secure bitcoin network.

For hackers, you do have to practice good opsec. 2fa if you hold your accounts or something called a hardware wallet. This is a device that holds the private key on it and creates transactions.

The key takeaway is that the lightning network is the next layer on top of bitcoin.

It absolutely has backing, that is the energy that goes into mining, it forms the security, making the database immutable. Bitcoin is secured by the energy that goes into mining the blocks.

I think we have a fundamental disagreement on what a currency is. Currencies don't require a government, company or demand to be a currency. They simply need 4 properties. From google.

This is called 'moving the goal posts'.. Read the white paper, and let me know what Satoshi thought his tech was about.

Because it's an unregulated asset, and there's manipulators everywhere. Tether is literally printing fake dollars, in their billions, and buying up Bitcoin with it to inflate the price..  Trade volumes are low, and it's very easy to manipulate the market with relatively little Bitcoin or dollars.. Or fake dollars in the from of Tether. 

The miners, exchanges, are all in cahoots and sometimes owned by the same people. The exchanges can completely manipulate the market at will by faking trade volumes. Multiple exchanges (now defunct) have done this, and got caught doing it. Look up willybot. That shit never ended just because Mt Gox crumbled..

It could be decades before they get back to this valuation, especially since they're about to have a lot more competition in their corner of the market.

"I highly doubt that that is what it is mostly used for. If it were, then bitcoin would have drained into such economies long ago, that isn't what has happened as far as I can tell. At the end of the day: either tulips or digital information produced by expensive to maintain cryptography COULD be the basis of value, but what you have to question is the use value in and of itself.

&amp;#x200B;

With currency, that use value is as legal tender for public debts, i.e. taxes: the government forces you to pay taxes in its currency, therefore you become desperate to obtain that currency to pay those debts. So currency actually DOES have a use value there: It prevents retribution from not paying taxes. This use value is made universal by the fact that we are a uniquely capable economy that many people want to have the ability to live in and move through in the most optimal way, therefore they will pay the fees needed to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

With bitcoin: the cryptography itself is inherently useless, it's as useless as the calories burned and flesh worn by someone who digs up a hole in the ground and then fills it back in again. But people can still place arbitrary value in those activities if they want. Someone can hire a person to print fungible certificates based entirely on the fact that someone dug up a hole and then filled it back in again and give them to the digger, and then that digger can try and sell those certificates, and, assuming that someone bought them knowing exactly what they are, then that indicates that people are, in fact, willing to put value into otherwise useless labor, thereby making it valuable. But that still doesn't, ultimately, change the fact that you are, in fact, paying for otherwise worthless labor and hoping that other people will pay your inherently hysterical act forward by buying it from you for as much or more than you paid for it.",1610076120.0,1

I would have to disagree with you there. Countries that face hyperinflation, also need to pay taxes in their currency. The US has been fine so far because it is the reserve currency for the world; however, we are slowly starting to see a shift. The US has now allowed banks to use stablecoins for its transactions, China has been building its digital currency. Times are changing, you can't judge everything by economic theories of the past.

My economic theories are literally just physics: things have value for their use. What is the use of The US Dollar? It pays taxes, therefore you will always have to have it in order to pay taxes in order to not die. That is an extraordinary use value for an asserted monetized commodity.

In order for cryptocurrencies to have universal value, they would have to be accepted as taxes. Why would the government waste millions of tons of valuable resources to mine crypto or try to determine what the value of any crypto out there is worth when they can just declare that they control the universal overarching legal debt that keeps goods and services flowing as peacefully as possible?

Ultimately, this means that cryptocurrency is going to be entirely limited to things where the inherent anonymity is key. You can host bitcoin and sell a percentage of it per year of your life in order for it to act like defacto rents on this open source money laundering ledger. But it will still always be, a mostly money laundering ledger, with other people using it out of fun and/or insane conspiratorial notions. Also, because the cost of cryptocurrency is mining it, it actually WILL be subject to inflation: The rate at which energy and resources are used to mine crypto. Why would we want to invest a MASSIVE portion of our GDP just to generating the money supply of a world wide crypto economy when we can just have the government do it for a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a percent of the total GDP?",1610109728.0,1
"What gives gold its value? You pay taxes in gold?

I personally don't think bitcoin can be used as a money exchange neither have I argued that it can. But it can and will be a store of value as gold is.

The money laundering argument is bad. Cash is used much more in illegal activities. How many times have banks come into public eye for money laundering? Deutsche bank paid millions in a money laundering settlement a few months back. The leaked documents in September 2020 showed over $2 trillion of money laundering from the biggest banks. Sub-prime mortgage securities were a scam in themselves.

Bitcoin addresses are public so to me it seems like banks have a higher chance of being involved in money laundering with their privatized ledgers than bitcoin. 

What do you mean *why would ""we"" want to invest*? Is your other argument suggesting that bitcoin would need to get nationalised in order to function? Bitcoin is decentralized. The people who want to mine it will mine it and pay for the costs.

You're right that it's now more of a reserve asset. Somewhat of an alternative to gold, it is designed to be a scarce resource. Unlike most currencies which have varying inflation, Bitcoin's inflation is low and well-defined, and cannot be manipulated. It has been moving in the direction of a reserve asset for several months, if not years, and as more institutional investors get involved and the price stabilizes, it will be a good store of value to prevent savings from depreciating in value. But there is no chance that it is going to become accepted as a global payment system.

"Well, the way a VPN works, you are essentially sending your traffic to the VPN provider, so instead of say Comcast seeing that you visit Google, your VPN Provider sees that you are visiting Google, and all your ISP (Comcast in my example) sees is your VPN, they can’t see the actual sites you visit as that is encrypted.

So, a well trusted VPN is important, because some providers keep logs, so if you visit Piratebay 500 times a month, they will keep a record of that. A GOOD VPN PROVIDER DOES NOT KEEP LOGS. Say you chose poorly, and your provider not only keeps logs, but is based in the US (and let’s say you are too). The Feds can make the provider turn over all logs that they keep, so everything you visited and did will be turned over. 

Now, I recommended Mullvad, they are part of the 14 eyes, which means that if requested, they will turn over the information stored on their servers, BUT they have been audited by a third party, and have proven themselves to NOT keep user logs, the only logs they keep are arbitrary metadata logs, that would not identify you at all. Outside that, you can also pay with Bitcoin to anonymize yourself further, and you don’t sign in with an email or anything, you sign into your Mullvad account with a like 12 digit number they provide you, keeping you very private. 

There are also vendors, such as ExpressVPN that are outside of the 14 eyes, so not only do they not keep any logs, so they have nothing to show what you are visiting while connected (same as Mullvad), BUT even if they were requested to turn over the information on their servers, they don’t have to comply, and can send over a big F*CK YOU to whatever agency is requesting the information.

"This is a primary source. Chainalysis is probably the premier private-sector Bitcoin tracing company right now.  They generated the data themselves. 

Most of these extremist groups have receiving addresses that are public record (they want people to know how to give them money) as well as the address that gave them the 28 Bitcoin. 

Associating this address to the address that identifies the person is a bit of a black box, but it will go something like this: all the other Bitcoin addresses this account interacted with are public record. It’s very common for one person to have used multiple addresses, and the way they interact can indicate whether or not they are owned by the same person with some degree of confidence. 

For instance, a person can send from two addresses that they control at the same time in the same transaction. Like if I have two accounts, A and B, A has 7 Bitcoin and B has 5. My ID is associated with account A publicly. I can send 12 all at once to an account C, but it becomes public that I control both A and B. Then, if I were to make a transaction that sent from both B and C at the same time, it would then be proof that I control all three. And you can work your way through all transactions made by those accounts and this is one of the ways you can link them together. 

One of these accounts that they are confident in associating has ID attached to it.

If a company were to hold 1000 bitcoins, the only value it could make of it would be to sell them. If no one wanted to buy the bitcoins, no company could make use of them in any way to produce anything.

There is always a debate over how to calculate value of assets but I believe that a shorthand is to either consider the current speculative value of an asset or its ability to produce something.

Advantages of cryptos:

- send money anywhere instantly and low fees/fee-less (best for remittance!)
- earn interest through staking
- get a loan with your cryptocurrency as your collateral 
- convert your money from EUR to USD to BTC to other cryptos without even going to the banks lol
- play games and earn cryptos
- lend your cryptos and earn interest
- provide liquidity and earn interest 

How to use crypto as a currency without the volatility: STABLECOINS. Stablecoins are cryptos pegged with fiat in a 1:1 ratio. 

Famous stablecoins:
- USDT (1:1 USD)
- USDC (1:1 USD)
- DAI (1:1 USD)

Other stablecoins
- EURB (1:1 Euro)
- CNY (Yuan)
- PHP (Philippine Peso)

"&gt;but the idea behind mining was always to reduce the supply of new currency and instead have a transaction fee.

Don't think you understand why there's mining. Mining is primarily to provide security to the network, and secondary (with nodes) to validate transactions. It's not to reduce the supply of currency. The supply of currency happens roughly every 10 minutes when 6.25 Bitcoin is taken from the supply not in circulation. This is all programed into the Blockchain code. Only way the rate of new currency supply can be changed is with a block reward halving, which happened in May 2020 and should happen again in 2024 when miners will only get 3.125 BTC per block.

The block reward will keep halving every 4 years until 2140 when all of the Bitcoin is part of the circulating supply. Then miners will be paid with transaction fees only.",1611482422.0,1

- Technically speaking, Bitcoin mining is a race to find the least expensive energy source as well as the most energy efficient hardware. This will naturally push to renewables.

- Countries/States that are selling electricity to miners are actually benefiting greatly. Most of these places waste the energy they produce because it is not being utilized and there’s no battery systems to collect and store that energy.

"Doesn't seem too tricky to calculate. An armored car probably uses something like 1L/5km of petroleum due to how heavy it is. 1L of petroleum contains 8.9kWh of energy; plus another 1.3kWh to refine the petroleum in the first place... call it 10kWh per 5km travelled.

Let's say the armored car travels 100kms in a day of moving gold and money and shit around between multiple bank branches... it's therefore used 200kWh of energy.

How many transactions has that cash facilitated? Probably somewhere between 5,000 and 50,000... let's call it 20,000. 

Therefore, the armored car component of a bank transaction is 0.01kWh.

One bitcoin transaction is 750kWh - 75,000 times more.

Anyone who says ""bitcoin is fine, think of the energy used by 'armored cars'"" had better have a list of 75,000 things like armored cars that apply to physical cash but not to bitcoin, because that's how many reasons they'd need to stack up to make them equivalently efficient.


ALL THAT SAID, bitcoin's goal is not to be ""as energy efficient as cash"", it's investors and believers do not use it because they're trying to meet or exceed that efficiency. Bitcoin solves different problems and it has it's own pros and cons.

Yes, the energy use is horrendous, and I'm sure it will eventually change (indeed, there are technically trivial code changes, like allowing 1000x more transactions per block, which would instantly reduce the energy costs per transaction by 1000x since the solve complexity doesn't change).

If I was looking to defend bitcoin's existing power use, my arguments for it would very much be along the lines of ""how much electricity usage is justified in order to provide a worldwide store of wealth for private individuals which cannot be frozen or confiscated by any governments, or rendered worthless by central banks at a whim? We've all seen what happens when national currencies go into cycles of hyperinflation: food riots, looting, violence, death.

"&gt; Everything you just said is how Wall Street operates all the time.

No, it really isn't. 

&gt;The only difference is when institutional investors do it, there's media supporting the rationale, while when WSB does it, there's media criticism.

No, the difference is that there are tons and tons of regulations to comply with, there are backstops and liability provisions for advisors, and the list goes on. 

To say that this is the same as what Wall Street does on a regular basis is like saying bitcoin is just a currency. It may seem that way at first glance, but it's far from reality. 

Let's be clear that I am not opposed to bitcoin *or* WSB - I think they both have a role to play. But completely unregulated activity in financial markets *do* create a significant risk that isn't to be ignored. 

&gt;Nothing happening here is unusual save that retail investors are making money at institutional investors' expense.

That's not true on several levels:

* It's unusual because the people manipulating the stocks are directly profiting from it; 
* Retail investors are making money all the time in all kinds of stock markets; and finally
* It's not at institutional investors' expense. That's ridiculously delusional. Look at all of the top holders of GME stock - it's the classic Wall Street giants. You've got Fidelity, you've got Blackrock, you've got State Street, etc. They're *all* on this train. 

The Melvins may seem like big fish to the average person, but in Wall Street circles, they're the small, disruptive upstarts. Blackrock wipes their asses with Melvin's annual earnings. 

&gt;But the market always has winners and losers, bubbles and crashes; if this is chaotic, then the markets are inherently chaotic, and to say otherwise is to engage in protectionist fallacy.

"I hate to be THAT GUY, but I should point out that I think Robinhood restricted buys because they were forced to by the DTCC.

DTCC or Depository Trust Clearing Corp is who gets stuck in the middle between when someone buys a stock and when the trade actually “settles” two days later. DTCC delivers the shares and waits for Robinhood to pay for them.

When the price of a stock fluctuates wildly, DTCC gets worried that if the stock price plummets before settlement Robinhood can’t or won’t pay for the now-worth-less shares. 

DTCC doesn’t trust that Robinhood can or will be paid for shares they sold to customers if the stock price falls before the trades settle. And Robinhood didn’t have enough money to put up to cover it.

Ask yourself... if you were a broker, how would you make sure you get paid for any shares a customer buys? What about people with bad checks, stolen credit cards, doing chargebacks, fraudulent bank info, etc? Who gets left holding the bag if the stock price falls? Remember back when Bitcoin was soaring a couple years ago, and people were buying it with credit cards. If it went up, they paid the bill, but when the price crashed they didn’t pay! 

I’m not defending Robinhood for what they do — they sell your orders to market makers who abuse your naivety and capitalize on the spread or front run you. Don’t forget that.",1611947518.0,-1

It’s a circular loop of risk. I see so much value in the potential of crypto currencies but at the same time struggle to see how it’s going to work out on the end. I’m certainly no expert by any means so I’m sure someone can prove me wrong but you also need non-experts to buy in. It makes my head hurt to think about it.

"Here's what I don't get about crypto currencies in general and Dogecoin in particular.

Bitcoin is serious.

Dogecoin is a joke.

Why?

Fundamentally, *why* is Dogecoin a joke? It seems to me to be 100% perception, which is bizarre to me. I know the makers treat it as a joke, but it seems to be backed up by the same technology as bitcoin and actually has one change that I think is a Good Economic Decision (tm), so there seems to be no fundamental reason why Dogecoin should be a joke and literally the only thing stopping it from being the future of cryptocurrency is people deciding it's the future of cryptocurrency. Conversely, why is Bitcoin (and Litecoin and Ethereum, which seem to be the big ones) serious?

With *actual* currency I can give some reasons why they are important. Why do people want US dollars? To buy or sell stuff with the biggest economy in the world (or near biggest, depending on how you measure it). That's a Good Reason. Another reason is that I pay my taxes in dollars, so I can't pretend that dollars don't exist.

Even the stock-market, which pretty clearly doesn't tie stock price to some coherent value over the short term, at least pretends to do so over the long term. Not *everything* in the stock market is priced based on the existence of a greater fool. We believe there's some fundamental value that the stock price reflects.",1612026100.0,1

"Not a lot. But what forces SEC intervention isn't that the stock rose, but because it rose so fast and so quickly without any action by the corporate management or economic fundamentals. GME rose 600% over a two day period, triggering the Nasdaq's circuitbreakers seven times in the process. A *single* circuitbreaker is enough to get the government's attention, multiple is when the Nasdaq's executives themselves call the government and ask for advice. In this case, low rent brokerages were told to temporarily suspend trading as the government comes in to review everything to ensure Gamestop's executives didn't do anything illegal.

This is completely reasonable, especially when the Nasdaq itself has not suspended GME trading at all. Neither have the brokers I use. However, the brokers I go to are physical people in physical offices - humans who will tell me No to my face if they beilive what I'm doing is beyond what my credit score supports. Robinhood, E-trade and others are essentially doing that but by proxy (physically locking users out of certain functions) and users are having a hard time understanding why buying stock is not easy like buying Bitcoin is.

All of this makes more sense if you talk to your banker at your own bank. If you read your own checking account's TOS you will notice that the nicer savings accounts allow users to funnel money into stock funds and play with it like you would with Robinhood. Which I mention because that's where everything is tied, banks where all deposited money is gambled.

"&gt;Why would anyone mine if they lost money doing it.

Three reasons:

1. They don't know any better and aren't very smart
2. They're using someone else's electricity and effectively just stealing money from the bill-payer's pocket
3. They live somewhere like China or near a hydroelectric dam that offers extremely cheap or free electricity (like $0.04/kWh or less.)

&gt; I pay the highest electricity rate in the US and it amounts to 1/3 my earnings. The other 2/3 is profit.

So you live in Hawaii and pay [$0.28/kWh](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/) and you mine *Bitcoin* not some other coin and you think you're making a profit?

The last time I looked the Antminer S9 was right at the top of the most efficient miners per watt, and at Hawaii electricity rates it will earn you -$3.57 per day.  That's right, negative - it costs $3.57 per day to run.

The break-even on an S9 is somewhere around $0.13/kWh, which is the average US electricity rate, but that's just to break even on electricity, not counting cooling costs or cost to purchase the hardware.

Bitcoin mining is not profitable unless you ignore the full economic picture.  If you get the hardware for free or significantly less than market rate, or if you get the electricity for free or significantly less than market rate, then you might make a profit.  For 99.99% of people, especially Americans, it's a money sink.

So I use BTC as my savings account with a c ouple of tx per year and BCH as my checkings account.

Long term more acceptance of cryptocurrencies will save electricity in other areas.

Also when difficulty goes down, the usage of electricity also goes down. There is no correlation between how much tx it can process and how much electricity it uses. 

And finally for miners, they need electricity as cheap as possible. So by far most of it is hydro and solar. I think about 80% of the electricity used in Bitcoin mining is green.

Bitcoin mining actually helps push for cheaper electricity then just burning gas and coal.

"While every Bitcoin holder is welcoming the increase in price, right now, I feel like it's bad for the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole. The difficulty of Bitcoin mining increases with the number of people doing it. Blocks are mined about every 10 minutes. There is a block reward of 6.25 BTC per block mined.... But with BTC now over $40k, that means that every block found rewards it's finder with $250k. Every 10 minutes. It's as if Tesla decided to release 300 new shares every 10 minutes, yet still the price goes up!

So since miners essentially turn electricity into blocks, this high block reward incentives miners to use as much cheap electricity as they can. Bitcoin's energy footprint is directly related to it's price (and the block reward). As long as price goes up, so does it's energy footprint.

If there's a silver lining, it's that the protocol developers designed the reward to decrease over time and eventually be eliminated. The block reward is halved (roughly) every 4 years, so in 20 years the block reward will be a shade under .2 BTC. For the block rewards to be equivalent to right now, BTC would have to be worth $1.25 million by then.

"You have a great point! I actually think this additional “tax” on crypto assets would actually build up renewable capacity faster and help everyone! Here’s why:

Currently, there is a finite amount of electricity and its incredible tough to store (great recent NPR planet money podcast on this challenge). As demand for power goes up during the day, additional power plants kick on, more coal is burned, etc. to meet this demand but there’s no great way to store power when demand is low. Thus, plants reduce capacity during evenings/nights as power generated during this time is wasted due to no use (even renewable energy sources have this problem). Currently coal powered plants are cheap to build and provide the ability to directly adjust power generation by burning more or less coal proportionately to meet demand. What if we had a way to store excess energy generated from renewable sources coupled with more efficient/scalable energy sources?

Couple this storage problem with the nature of utility companies which are semi-subsidized government entities with mandated pricing structures. This pricing structure rightfully prohibits price gouging but prevents profit maximizing entities to innovate new storage/generation methods. I pay the same electricity rate per watt as that crypto miner who might use 500 times more power. Because of the nature of power generation, utility companies are forced to build new power plants to meet the ever increasing demand. This new plant costs money to build!! Is it fair that my electrical rate and taxes rise equally with that crypto miner even though the miner is responsible for the increased demand that lead to new plant construction?

So what does this all have to do with Bitcoin? I think an additional “tax” on crypto assets to offset the power consumption could provide the funds needed for new storage technology and renewable energy advances. I fear that without additional funding sources we might not see the renewable energy advances we need for a carbon neutral country bc of the way utility companies are incentivized.

Bitcoin is a great idea and I believe it has noble origins, however, I don’t think the creator(s) themselves ever thought it would reach this level of popularity. As more people use the technology it’s going to draw more and more power that ultimately all of us have to pay for, whether we made money investing in Bitcoin or not.",1612981948.0,1

Additionally, gold mining lacks the ability to fully rely on renewable energy due to mining equipments (oil) and mines that are far from traditional infrastructure. This dosn't account for the hazordous waste and destroyed ecosystem that is created by gold mining. What people fail to account is that the Bitcoin network involves the mining, transportation, and the storage into the total energy consumption. The same can be applied to the banking system with its hidden energy consumption.

Additionally, with PoW the investment is in hardware, if you launch an attack and it fails, you still have all of the hardware and can just try again.  With PoS the investment is in coins, if you launch an attack and it fails, you lose all of those coins and have to buy your way back in.

Bitcoin is possibly the best thing ever at being “hard money” because it will ultimately become more scarce than gold (measuring by the amount of new BTC produced or new gold mined each year). As far as crypto, Bitcoin has first mover status, and it’s true origins are a bit mysterious. 

So how would Bitcoin become a real currency? That remains to be seen, but the longer it’s around the longer it’s around.

Printing more than the required amount to keep up leads to inflation, but printing the exact required amount does not lead to inflation despite money being printed.

"I've been in crypto for 8 years now. I bought my first Bitcoin when I was still in school with money I saved up. There was no way that I believed that this little nerdy project could be worth almost a trillion dollar nearly a decade later. It was just a cool project for a young programming student with interest in cryptography. But my interest in Bitcoin faded away from year to year. The network proved itself to be unable to perform any big protocol updates, making the energy problem so much more frustrating.
  
So I'll do my best to give rather simplified overview of the issues at heart here if you want to know more:   
   
-) There's a part of the bitcoin community for which this excesive energy cost is waranted and simply the ""small"" price to pay for a free peoples money.     
-) Some Bitcoiners are whats called ""Bitcoin maximalists"", basically that Bitcoin is the only true coin and everything else is garbage.    
-) (!) The energy consumption problem has been solved. But. And there's always this big last BUT (and I think this is the most important one to understand since I don't think that many people know this).    
-) Bitcoin, as in Bitcoin the software, developers and community, is extremely conservative regarding big protocol changes. This may seem very counter intuitive at first, a digital peer to peer currency that wants to liberate peoples finance - conservative? The reasons for this are complex but again I'll try my best:     
     
1) Since Bitcoin is decentral, you can't just update it like you would update your phone. For big changes to get adopted, you need a majority (and ideally a very significant majority) of support for it.   
    
2) And there are three big actors in Bitcoin. Miners, Developers and Users. In order to agree on a protocol change, you need a majority (and ideally a very significant majority) on all people to agree on this change. If you don't have 100% support, there will be what's called a ""fork"". Basically the bunch of people who didn't agree on the change are continuing Bitcoin on the old version, ultimately splitting Bitcoin in two. This has already happened multiple times for this exact reason, not everyone agreed on Bitcoins future direction and a split occured. This is why the developers are very carefull with huge upgrades (some might say, they are not doing them at all).
  
Which brings me to my last point. Earlier I mentioned that there are solutions available right now that could solve the energy problem. But you are now starting to understand, why a simple switch is not realistic. Bitcoin maximalists will not abandon their ship. So we need to upgrade the protocol. Big protocol updates need a huge majority.
  
And, even if we managed to pull off the support for such a huge change, there's one group of actors that will never adopt this change: Miners. You see, mining is their bread and butter. They invested heavily in huge mining operations costing millions. And they are making tons of profit. And they rather keep it that way. Changing the underlying code from resource wasting algorithm to something more efficient, basically cut's them of the network and with them all their profits. Why would they vote themself out of the door?
  
So it's not all just technical difficulties with Bitcoin, but also huge political issues. And those actors, whoever they are, are fighting for your voice to support their self interest. Which escalates this political issues even more. And with politics, you are constantly fighting those ""alternate facts"". There isn't really a huge consensus among users themself on whether there are in fact ""real alternatives"" to mining. Or if ""there will ever be one"". Or they warant it by the statement I made above, that ""this is simply the price we have to pay"". That's where we are at.
   
At some point, governments will probably start to weigh in and lead a discussion, on whether mining should be legal or not. That's probably inevitable if we can't fix this issue on our own.",1612987292.0,1

"Worth a read, from casebitcoin.com;

""Bitcoin's energy spend is required to do three things: fairly distribute new bitcoin according to bitcoin's monetary policy, allow anyone to participate in the bitcoin network on even footing, and create the strong security assurances around bitcoin's transaction settlement. Any financial system will have certain properties and guarantees, and they never come for free.

Financial systems require infrastructure and security one way or another. In the case of gold, enormous amounts of effort and energy are spent to both mine it and securely store it. For modern government currencies, the physical banking infrastructure, and human capital to make it all work and settle correctly is extremely costly. These costs are usually not directly measured in energy, but it could be expressed that way in theory, and they'd be very large numbers.

With bitcoin, the creation of the asset, as well the processing of transactions, and the assurances around bitcoin's security are all bundled into the mining process which deliberately expends energy. The energy is spent as a ""proof of work,"" the sum of which assures that bitcoin's transaction ledger cannot be changed. This is essential for bitcoin's monetary policy certainty, as well as other key properties. With hundreds of billions of dollars in market cap and billions of dollars settled on the bitcoin network every day, there is clearly significant demand for the services bitcoin provides, and bitcoin mining expends energy to support those services. This energy spend is not wasted; the market explicitly demands it.

Additionally, bitcoin mining has strong reliance on renewable energy, and furthermore, the hyper competitive and global nature of bitcoin mining suggests that it may eventually rely almost completely on renewables, since they are likely to be one of the cheapest power sources long-term. Jack Dorsey, CEO of Square, recently noted:

“We believe that cryptocurrency will eventually be powered completely by clean power, eliminating its carbon footprint and driving adoption of renewables globally... Published estimates indicate bitcoin already consumes a significant amount of clean energy, and we hope that Square’s investment initiative will accelerate this conversion to renewable energy.” """,1612988553.0,1

Fourth, the fact that different countries have different currencies allows the offset of differences in economic growth. A fixed currency for the whole world would make inequalities between countries worse.

"Probably not. The power consumption per transaction you see is merely an estimate.

The complexity of bitcoin is usually hidden from the user. You just send some coins to someone, but in the bitcoin network, you don't actually send coins the way you think you do.

Basic explanation of transactions: A transaction consists of 2 parts. In the first part, you specify all inputs where you want to take coins from and prove that these inputs are yours. In the second part, you specify where **all** coins from those inputs go (you can't specify to only use part of an input, all is consumed). Unspecified coins are considered the transaction fee and given to whoever mines the first block that contains your transaction. This means if I have three inputs of 0.9 BTC each and I want to give you 2 coins, I have to collect all 3 inputs (total 2.7 BTC), then in the output send 2 coins to you, and send 0.699 coins back to myself (minus some decimals for transaction fee). So this transaction converts 3 inputs of 0.9 BTC each into two outputs of 2 and 0.699 coins. These two outputs can later be used as inputs again.

If all your inputs are very small (common when mining or continuously buying small amounts), you will end up with a transaction that has to specify dozens of inputs to reach the amount of BTC you want to spend. Your transaction will get larger and occupy more of the allocated block size.

The power consumption is probably calculated by looking at how much power BTC consumes in 10 minutes (the block interval) and divided by the average number of transactions. It's important to know that a transaction by itself doesn't consumes any power beyond what is used to transport it over the internet.

The huge power consumption is only caused by generating blocks, therefore it's probably more interesting to see how much energy is consumed for every block. The annual consumption is 77780 GWh. To get to 10 minutes, we do `77780/365.25/24/6` which gives us roughly 1.48 GWh for each block. That energy is consumed regardless of the size/number of transactions.",1612991914.0,-1

* Step 1: Assemble the list of transactions to be added to the next block
* Step 2: Add a random value
* Step 3: Hash the block + value

You can make your own bitcoin with an exact copy of the bitcoin blockchain right now if you wanted to, that's exactly how BCH was made and why people who had BTC holdings prior to the fork got the equivalent amount of BCH. People keep not understanding that bitcoin is decentralized, if the majority of nodes agree to a protocol change, that's the new protocol. See the SegWit activation that was one of the major points of contention for the BCH split: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SegWit

If bitcoin fails to scale, a fork won't. BCH is still around certainly but hasn't come anywhere near BTC's success. Even if the primary makers of the bitcoin software wanted to take it in a direction the users don't agree with, the users will just fork. Part of crypto's scalability is being able to implement technology changes to solve problems like this, on the basis of network consensus. Just like how proof of stake can solve the energy problem with mining. You come up with a better solution than proof of work or proof of stake? Cool, make it, you can do that!",1612992314.0,1

"Sure crypto may be a future, but I very much doubt any of the current cryptocurrencies will be used as actual currencies in the conceivable future.

&gt; It’s deflationary nature - is actual nature. Stop trying to control money and make it work OPPOSITE of how it should work.

I mean, money used to work like this and it was a big problem, which is why literally every country in the world uses fiat now. Deflation is generally considered bad because if you know the value of money will increase in the future, you have an incentive to keep it rather than spend it, which is bad for the economy.

&gt;It’s not very private - no digital money is. At least Bitcoin doesn’t require your name and info to be able to exchange money.

Sure, but this is one aspect where you can expect much more regulation in the future. As it is, cryptocurrencies are  used a lot for illegal activities and it's only a matter of time before governments start restricting that. The main point I wanted to make though is that with bitcoin every transaction is public and that's not really something that's desirable for a currency. Sure, with normal banking system you are not anonymous, but this information is not public, there's a big difference.

Bitcoin obviously uses vastly more energy than conventional systems, I don't understand why it's even a discussion. For example, I'm from Czech Republic, which is a country with about 10 million people. Bitcoin used more energy last year than the whole country. Bitcoin processes about 400,000 transactions per day, which is not much. I don't know how many transactions there is every day in Czech Republic, but I'm sure that if you count all the credit card transactions, bank transfers etc., it's much more than 400,000 per day, yet the the finance system uses only a tiny fraction of all the energy usage in the country.

I don't think governments will necessarily ban bitcoin, although I think much more regulation can be expected in the future. I'm saying it will not become a currency. Sure, bitcoin is very expensive now, but it's not really used as a currency. For it to replace a dollar or another fiat currency, you would need to have a state backing it and that is not going to happen. Not because governments are evil, but because current cryptocurrencies are simply not well suited for that purpose. 

As it is cryptocurrencies are really cool pieces of technology, but outside of illegal activities, at this point, they are basically giant, (kinda) decentrilazed, open pyramid schemes. Maybe one day bitcoin they will become a store of value similar to gold, maybe they find some niche uses and maybe they will all crash spectacularly, but I doubt that they will become actual currencies.",1612992394.0,-1

"Bitcoin, as specified by the original white paper, is very scalable. Satoshi (the anonymous creator of Bitcoin) said it best himself:

&gt; It never really hits a scale ceiling...

And this is true. The problem with Bitcoin as it is now, is that it has an artificial ceiling of 1MB per block, or about a maximum of 7 transactions per second. This is not a technological limit, but one artificially built into the protocol. This limit was originally implemented when Bitcoin was barely used (blocks were just a few kilobytes on average), in order to prevent bad actors flooding the network with free spam transactions, but Bitcoin usage has grown by several orders of magnitude since then. 

Starting approximately 2015, there was an unprecedented and very divisive debate between Bitcoin enthusiasts, with one side believing that the block size limit should be removed, as was originally intended, and the other side arguing that removing the limit would hinder the decentralization quality of Bitcoin, and suggesting other ""second-layer"" scaling solutions (lightning network and others). Many go-to information sources were accused of implementing censorship and propaganda tactics in order to further the ""keep the limit"" viewpoint, but I will not go into that here. In the end, Bitcoin split into two separate chains with the same transaction history up until the point of the split. BTC keeping the 1MB limit and concentrating on additional layers for scaling, while keeping the base blockchain as a settlement layer, and BCH vastly increasing the limit, and implementing other on-chain scaling optimizations.

The idea on BTC is that eventually, almost all base-layer transactions will be ""settlement transactions"", batching many second-layer transactions together, thus every transaction will have a large mining fee, which will substitute the block reward once it runs out, even if (and because) the transaction count is artificially limited (think Lamborghini earning thousands on each car, because their supply is so limited). 

The idea on BCH is to eventually have many transactions with a negligible mining fee, with the fees adding up to substantial amounts due to the amount of them (this Coca-Cola earning just pennies on each can of drink, while still having  profits due to the massive total volume).

So far, BCH has always had orders of magnitude lower fees than BTC. Opponents point out that this is because not as many people use BCH in comparison with BTC, but the transaction amount is still rising on BCH (and it would as well on BTC, but that is impossible due to the artificial limit)",1612992990.0,-1

I read a few articles and saw couple documentaries on it and I am still trying to eyeball exactly how scarce it is, let alone world at large. 
Gold has centuries of track record and held up worth even when the whole currency system was changed from gold backed.

If you are storing value, you want peace of mind and an established market. You know you can sell gold easily and relatively fast, but also you can reasonably expect governments not to set out to sabotage gold.

It is less exposed to regulation, ie, government coming after those capital gains when converting virtual coin back to government backed cash, with an environmental tax or whatever tax. Or a transaction tax on purchases made using it. The governments have many ways to go after it I cant even think of, and as decentralized as it can be at the end of the day every company of relevance (like Tesla) will ultimately abide by government and international regulation.
This is all stuff that is out of the focus of big government and the mainstream - for now. Its easy to dismiss them as unable to affect something decentralized like virtual coin, but how true is that.

Plus, ultimately gold does have practical uses, industrial applications, the uniqu characteristcs of the metal, and commercial appeal for its own sake (big market for jewelry etc).

I think its more comparable to art pieces than gold, as far as a scarce commodity goes. Which btw are indeed used as a store of value mostly by rich people and also for tax reason advantages. But more niche and with wackier value fluctuations than gold.",1612996358.0,1

"Metcalfe's Law does directly link to the number of users so to some degree the number of users is part of the strength.  More users means more people who will buy it up if the price has a large price drop.  It also means more nodes so you have a stronger more robust decentralized network that can survive attacks and government censorship far better than a newer, less popular crypto.  It also means it is backed by the most hash power, which makes it far less vulnerable to a 51% attack as well.

The age speaks to the validity of the project and strength of the code security, something that other crypto currencies lack.  If it had just been some fad then it should have died out by now.  It should have died after Mt Gox.  Or after it was banned in at least a dozen countries including China and India.  Or after the last several crashes like when it went from $20k to ~$3,500.  If there was some critical security vulnerability in the code then hackers should have found it by now.  

And it should be pointed out that not all crypto's are intended to compete or replace bitcoin or other currencies.  You have many that are trying to be decentralized social media platforms, or video and file sharing or hosting platforms for example.  Or projects like Ethereum that is more of a decentralized Amazon Web server than a currency.

**The crackdown begins (again)**

**The narrative**

In recent weeks, both India and Nigeria have made noises about banning crypto industry participants’ access to the traditional banking sector. This could be a sign of renewed government crackdowns on the space. 

**Why it matters**

Bitcoin and subsequent cryptocurrencies were designed to be censorship-resistant, stateless and a tool of economic freedom. Citizens in Belarus and Nigeria used bitcoin (BTC, +5.06%) to raise funds for those who lost their jobs or otherwise faced repercussions for protesting against authoritarian regimes. People in other countries use cryptocurrencies as a way of cheaply transferring value across borders. 

But the crypto space might not yet be mature enough to actually fulfill those goals – at least, not entirely. Ray Dalio, head of major hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, said government prohibition could have a significant negative impact on cryptocurrency adoption, and we’re indeed seeing governments try to enact or enforce stringent regulation. 

**Breaking it down**

The Indian government began considering a bill that would ban private cryptocurrencies late last month, defining “private” as any cryptocurrency that’s not state-backed. The bill, which was introduced to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian parliament, also suggested that India could launch its own central bank digital currency (CBDC), issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the nation’s central bank. 

There are two details here that stick out to me, The first is that the RBI tried to restrict cryptocurrencies once before, when it told banks they could not provide services to crypto companies in 2018. That ban was later struck down by the nation’s Supreme Court, though RBI vowed to fight the ruling. This new bill, which was also introduced in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house), could be a natural evolution of that policy goal, one that would have the force of law behind it.",1613065997.0,-1
"[2]

The second detail is the Indian government has also tried to control its financial system before. In 2016, the government demonetized the ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes, some 86% of the circulating currency, nominally in an effort to stamp out “black money,” or cash held from illicit means. In 2018, India’s Aadhaar system decided every resident effectively needed access to the biometric identification platform in order to buy a cell phone or access banking services. 

A continent away, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) published a document saying banks cannot provide crypto exchanges with services. Binance and Bundle Africa immediately announced they would suspend deposits. 

Here, too, the CBN says its ban isn’t new, but rather that its statement last week is merely reiterating a position it has held since 2017. Still, the timing of the move is interesting, coming just months after residents began using bitcoin to raise funds as part of the #ENDSARs movement. 

Basically, this looks like a trend. Crypto is getting to a place where governments have to pay attention to it. Some industry insiders seem less alarmed about Nigeria’s ban than their Indian counterparts are about the subcontinent’s ban.",1613066017.0,-1

Also, we're already past peak according to multiple accounts. We even have a major oil company admitting it now. Going forward extracting oil gets to be more difficult and expensive. 

As for the environment, you're right. We've already done enough to really screw ourselves. Now imagine that you're in the year 2050 and the cost of everything is going up because of the increased cost of oil.

(Bloomberg) -- Miami Mayor Francis Suarez proposed paying municipal workers and collecting taxes in Bitcoin, expanding a campaign to promote cryptocurrencies.

The mayor wants to allow the City of Miami’s workers to choose to receive all or a portion of their pay in Bitcoin, according to a resolution passed by the city’s governing commission. In addition, the mayor proposed allowing people to pay all or part of property taxes or city fees in crypto.

Although the commission approved the resolution 4-1, it significantly dialed back its original wording. It only agreed to study the practicality of such steps, rather than taking action, as the original proposal had suggested.

Suarez has been courting Silicon Valley investors and technology companies for months, and adopting Bitcoin is a critical part of that plan. “I think we’re on the cusp of seeing a major titanic shift on this,” Suarez told the city commission. ”It’s an industry that’s boisterous, vociferous and growing, and this would send the right signal.”

Suarez also wants the city to analyze the feasibility to invest some government funds in Bitcoin, the resolution said. It’s not clear how much of that is actually possible: Florida statutes have strict limitations on how local governments can invest surplus funds, generally restricting investments to low-volatility instruments such as those issued by the U.S. government. In the past year alone, Bitcoin has shown it can double in price -- or lose half its value -- in a month’s time.

Suarez doesn’t seemed fazed by volatility: Miami, the mayor’s original resolution said, “is committed to promoting the emergence of Bitcoin as it continues to gain mainstream acceptance.”

Some city commissioners cautioned against embracing Bitcoin without a close study of the risks. “Let’s analyze this before we jump in,” said Manolo Reyes, a commissioner. “Maybe you’re ahead of your time, maybe you’re right, but let’s analyze it.”

New Ideas

Suarez, who is up for re-election this year, has portrayed himself as someone who is willing to consider and promote new ideas. Late in 2020, he started engaging with Silicon Valley technology investors on Twitter, and his efforts to lure them to Miami have become a viral sensation.",1613176587.0,1
"[2]

While Suarez’s Twitter campaign may have given him new influence, the mayor of the City of Miami doesn’t control the budget or municipal workforce or get a vote on the commission. He asked voters to give him more managerial power, but the initiative failed.

The proposal comes in a week when Tesla Inc. disclosed it had made a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin, a big vote of confidence from the world’s leading electric-carmaker. Mike Novogratz, the billionaire founder of cryptocurrency investment firm Galaxy Digital, said in an interview Monday that “it’s the messaging that matters,” even if the investments themselves are relatively small.

In the resolution, the mayor described Bitcoin as an increasingly popular asset for people, corporations and major investors. The plan is part of a campaign to make Miami a city that “embraces new technologies,” the resolution said.

Ken Russell, vice-chairman of the city commission, said he’s “certainly not opposed” to the idea of integrating Bitcoin into the city’s business, but it’s important to ensure “we all know what we’re getting into.”

“What needs to be done is diligence, and not just from the legal perspective,” he said in an interview Wednesday. “It’s not just a currency, it’s a concept.”",1613176605.0,1

"The key to the tesla purchase has to do with the way crypto is currently classified as an ""indefinite lived tangible asset"".

Under this classification the tesla corporation is able to write off any losses accrued on bitcoin from their purchase price. So if the price drops and their bitcoin is now worth only 1 billion, they can write off a 500 million dollar loss on their tax return.

If however the price goes up, being an indefinitely lived tangible asset meams they do not need to report any gains if the price rises. 

So basically they dont have to report gains until they sell it, and they can write off any losses they accrue. Its a very safe bet on Teslas part because they undoubtedly have hundreds of millions of dollars a year in taxes owed and can offset that tax bill with bitcoin losses and stand to make a profit if bitcoin gains.

"Bitcoin is not really suited for the amount of transactions it gets nowadays but that metric is is independent of how many miners are on the blockchain.

Miners put the transactions into a block (up to 500 go in a block I believe). They then try to solve the block by doing a bunch of computational work. If they are the first to solve the block the network creates new bitcoin to pay them for their work. People pay transaction fees to incentivize miners for putting their transaction in the next block.

The key here is that a block will always take around 10 minutes to solve. So when more people start mining on the network there has to be an equal increase in difficulty of solving blocks. Therefore an increase in mining power has no relation to transaction throughput.

This is the biggest issue with Bitcoin imo. 500 transactions every 10 minutes is not even close to enough and the lightning network is not doing enough to fix the problems with using Bitcoin.",1613508153.0,-1

Put another way, if I buy a billion dollars in cat turds because I (and a bunch of my crazy friends) think that they are going to increase in value, why should I get to write off a billion dollars in losses from my taxes when it turns out that cat turds really aren't worth a goddamn thing?  :P

This is how anything of value works.

The backing of the US state actually provides zero real value, believe it or not. Gold is priced the way it is because it is rare.

Compare it to iron for example, iron is one of the most useful minerals we have but it is very cheap because we have so much of it.

"\&gt;And yet it's the ""international currency"" if there was one. Traveling you can use a USD just about anywhere. That's not true for many, if any other currencies.

It's true for Bitcoin also.

\&gt; What it was meant to do, and what people are trying to use it for doesn't line up. I have read it, but ecommerce sites attempting to accept it for payment, such as [Overstock.com](https://overstock.com/), and Tesla doing it etc, isn't really showing that it's being used how it was intended to be used.    


Who put you in charge of determining ""how it was intended to be used""? An S&amp;P 500 company accepting it as payment doesn't count for you? Literally what would?

\&gt; What ""software international bank""? There's a lot of stories of online wallets being hacked, or just straight up stolen. Offline wallets are easy to lose a ton of value.  

Bitcoin is the bank. It verifies every transaction is valid, it ignores invalid transactions. Any individual wallet can be hacked, offline wallets cannot be if they are used properly. If I were to lock my keys in my car, or lose my keys, should I be mad at the manufacturer that I can no longer get into my car? No, it's my fucking fault!   


Bitcoin is 100% personal financial freedom, but 100% responsibility comes with that. 

\&gt; You're not saying what this value is? What is the real world application you'd want this for? There's certainly a lot of downside. Not being able to reverse transactions means your money can be stolen and you have no way to ever get it back. 

Being able to trust 100% someone you've never even met is the value. If you're in Africa and you want to buy something from me, I cannot trust any fiat transaction as 30% of all transactions coming out of the country are fraudulent. With Bitcoin, you cannot pretend to send me some and then take it back days or weeks later. Reversible transactions have lost plenty of hard working and honest people money. 

\&gt; You're talking about it at it's all time peak price. This isn't new, and the price will most likely crash, as we have seen throughout it's history.

"Well clearly your very biased against bitcoin lol. To say bitcoin has zero value is false. Think of bitcoin as a buisness. The product is a decentralized list that is secured through blockchain technology and tracks an asset (satoshis) to different holders (wallets).  The buisness of bitcoin is maintaining that list.  

That list generates money in 2 ways. It turns electricity into transaction fees, meaning people who run nodes process the transactions between customers and generates a small fee for doing that work. This is a service that is provided by the network and that you the consumer are paying for access to.  

The second way it generates money is by producing more satoshis. The production of satoshis ( or mining) will be in place until the year 2150ish. These satoshis are the incentive for miners to stay active while the network grows. The network transaction fees will eventually be the only way bitcoin generates money and therefore must be happening in a large enough volume to remain profitable. (Meaning the electricity cost to transaction fee ratio needs to stay positive to the transaction side.)

So thinking that bitcoin is a ponzi scheme is a fallacy, it is a service.  The issue is in the valuation of that service.  People like to say theres only 21 million bitcoins, but thats also a misconception because in reality there is 100 million satoshis in every bitcoin. Meaning there are 2.1 quadrillion satoshis on the network.

So what is the value of a decentealized network of assets with extremely easy storage requirements ( 1 million dollars in silver for instance is very very hard to store transport and sell) and is non inflatable and can be destroyed (meaning people lose their wallet passwords that bitcoin is now destroyed)

For people who believe in a one world economy, an asset like bitcoin is valuable, it allows for the storage of value cheaply and easily and it can be transported ""instantly"" and at low costs anywhere in the world.

In my opinion there is no doubt that bitcoin has value, the issue comes in its valuation.  Currently the buisnesses is only generating a small amount of money in transaction fees and mostly generating ita money through mining more satoshis. Owning bitcoin is essentially a bet, that bitcoin will be accepted by the main stream and generate enough transaction volume to make the fees the predominant money generator.

But here is the issue with that.  To gain enough traction as a true currency, it needs the backing of a government.  And why would any government choose bitcoin? It is heavily held by a small number of people, and it is not going to be under their control.  Its far more likely that a government will just make their own centralized version of bitcoin they have control of and use that if they decide to go towards a digital currency.

So bitcoin is really a financial revolution.  If enough people agree it is money, it will be money.  But its a long hard road to get to the point of being the global standard by which buisness transactions are based.  So if you think bitcoin is the future, you think a one world economy with little government intervention is the future.  If you dont believe in bitcoin, you think that governments will never relinquish financial power and will continue to have individual economys pegged to their own baskets of assets.",1613510769.0,1

It's not just me. It's all economic experts. It's buying invisible shares in an imaginary Brooklyn Bridge.

What a ridiculous analogy. Bitcon clearly isn't a ""business"". It has no assets, workers, creditworthiness, products or services produced, etc. etc. 

&gt;The product is a decentralized list that is secured through blockchain technology and tracks an asset (satoshis) to different holders (wallets). The buisness of bitcoin is maintaining that list.

Nonsense. Bitcoin technology is free and open source and has value in numerous applications. Bitcon assets are worthless. The Bitcon pool of money is equal to no more than all of the money put into it by suckers over the years MINUS all the money taken out of his by scammers.

&gt;This is a service that is provided by the network and that you the consumer are paying for access to.

The service based on free and open source technology is FREE. What you are paying for is an *imaginary commodity* tacked by a free technology. 

&gt;The second way it generates money is by producing more satoshis.

Another meaningless and valueless word. It's an arbitrarily fixed scarcity that could easily be adjusted by the algorithm to be ten thousands times as many. That's pure sucker bait.

&gt;So what is the value of a decentealized network of assets with extremely easy storage requirements

Nothing. That aspect is based on the TECHNOLOGY and it is FREE and OPEN SOURCE.

&gt;one world economy

Nonsense. Bitcon is an imaginary commodity being traded by a collection of suckers and scammers. Nothing more. We already have a ""one world"" economy because we all live on just one world, mate.

Example: If a thousand people trade cat turds and they tell each other that cat turds are increasing in value, the world economy does NOT see cat turds as worth more. All it sees is a bunch of crazy kooks trading cat turds for real money.

&gt;Owning bitcoin is essentially a bet

No, it's a scam. With takers and losers. It's not even gambling. As Musk shows, it's RIGGED gambling. 

It's digital musical chairs. One day the music will stop.

&gt;bitcoin will be accepted by the main stream 

It never will be. At this point, after this many years, Bitcon suckers should realize that economists, governments, and financial institutions have caught on to this scam and will NEVER allow their own corporations be put as risk with this obvious scam.

Example: ""One day the entire world will run Linux on the desktop."" Never gonna happen...and Linux actually exists!  :)

&gt;And why would any government choose bitcoin?

No reason to. They can just use their own currency (which is valued using real world metrics going back thousands of years) and apply the free and open source encrypted spreadsheet technology to it if they want the flexibility of actual legitimate e-currency.

&gt;Its far more likely that a government will just make their own centralized version of bitcoin they have control of and use that if they decide to go towards a digital currency.

Yup. Bitcon has no real world value and no unique technological value (since the technology is already freely available to everyone).

&gt;So bitcoin is really a financial revolution

No, it isn't. We already have digital currency (like the dollar) that works just fine with all banks and institutions and commodities worldwide.

What Bitcon really is is a revolution in the old ""I want to sell you shares of the Brooklyn Bridge"" scam. Bitcon revolutionarily removed the piece of paper you had to print the bunko shares onto before you handed them to the marks.  And, I guess, it even removed the Brooklyn Bridge from it as well, replacing it with an imaginary version of gaming gold (except that gaming gold actually has a human labor cost to it). Revolutionary, indeed.

&gt;So there is actually 2.3x more ""bitcoins"" than pennies.

Thanks, I didn't know that. Trying to learn about it ... can you recommend a source for further reading?

I read this article so far which was a start but also kind of bloated: https://mashable.com/feature/carbon-coin-climate-change-crypto

&gt; a Bitcoin-like currency that the Ministry gives out for carbon sequestration — that is, any project that sucks CO2 out of the air, whether it’s carbon capture or farmers rewilding their fields — at a rate of one coin to one ton. Oil companies get coins if they stop being oil companies, basically, leaving their assets in the ground 

[...]

&gt; The key point is that the world’s central banks agree to back it, buying Carbon Coins on a schedule that slowly raises their price. The planet-saving coin thus becomes the safest investment in history, even more so than U.S. Treasury bonds.

[...]

&gt; Farmers in the developing world who’ve never heard of a VC could get the coin just for changing their agricultural practice or letting fields fall fallow; it’s literally money for nothing, from nothing. “The interesting thing about this funding model is there are no costs for anybody,” says Chen. “No citizen of the world will be hit with a tax, no business will be paying out. No governments will either.”

2. We supported the overthrow of pretty much every single democratically elected government in south america. Because socialism is bad, and taking care of people is bad. mmkay....

3. We supported the imprisonment of pretty much anyone who wants to ingest psychedelics. Why? Because preachers are worried that people might be able to find an escape from the misery of life in drugs, rather than on their knees, sucking the priests dick, and paying tithes to the church.

People didn't think the internet was scalable in the 80s and 90s when it was constrained to dial-up. BTC privacy and scalability is constantly improving with layer 2 solutions like lighting network and Bitcoin Core updates like Taproot.,1614706909.0,1

"&gt; Bitcoin is replacing banking infrastructure and gold.

For quite some time now btc is trying to move btc transaction of chain meaning that, no, bitcoin is not trying to replace the banking infrastructure it is trying to replace USD.

People are putting bitcoin around their necks and in to electronics now? /s

How is bitcoin replacing gold? I mean, we can say that about any asset on the market. I can look at assets that have higher market cap/bigger volume or whatever than gold and say that it is replacing gold. I'd be no more wrong than you are.

&gt; Bitcoin is replacing banking infrastructure and gold. If that's not true then why are visa and mastercard adding bitcoin infrastructure support?

To make money? Why are they adding bitcoin infrastructure support?

&gt;  Why is gold floundering in a volatile economic period when it should be thriving while Bitcoin is soaring to the moon? Why is the Bitcoin eco system thriving?

Maybe because gold and bitcoin are competing for same money and currently bitcoin is winning, I have no idea. Why is gold floundering?

I see bitcoin price is thriving, do not see its ecosystem thriving.

&gt; Whether you realize it or not this is a technology that revolutionizes modern financial infrastructure. It takes billions of dollars of infrastructure and tens of thousands of employees and makes them into ancient legacy networks.

Are you saying that when I walk in to a store and use my visa card that in the back there is an infrastructure worth billions of dollars and tens of thousands of people making sure my transaction (obviously not just mine) goes through safely? They do nothing else?

&gt; Why did Citibank just release a research paper confirming this?

I don't see a claim that bitcoin is replacing banking infrastructure or anything similar. Can you point to a specific sections where those claims are made? In the paper I can see that infrastructure is being built around bitcoin but not that bitcoin is replacing that infrastructure.

&gt; Why would you need CPAs, lawyers, and an army of accountants when you have a time stamping ledger that cryptographically proves ledger distribution every 10 minutes?

Today a colleague payed for lunch. I transferred here my part directly from my bank account to hers. It was free, it was done in seconds and no CPAs, lawyers or accountants were involved. I don't see what point you are trying to make here.

What's the process from preventing them from creating and destroying money? Ever think about that? Obviously not. How do two separate databases make sure they are balanced? This is the breakthrough in distributed computing that bitcoin provides. So yes. Yes it is.
&gt; A distributed database absolutely is a holy grail of computer science. Before bitcoin was invented, and you made a claim that you had a distributed database you would have been laughed out of the room because it was proven impossible.

 [XA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X/Open_XA) is a standard from 1991 on how to make transaction to distributed databases. So no, you wouldn't be laughed out of the room if you said that you had a distributed database.

&gt; https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/MIT-LCS-TM-394.pdf
&gt; Hence the biggest breakthrough since the internet. You dismiss with a simple 'no', because you have no idea what your talking about.

You do understand that the paper that you linked to doesn't state that distributed databases are impossible, right?

&gt; Bitcoin is going to be using far less energy than the current banking system when it scales up.

Not if it wants to provide all the services to all the people that the current banking system does.

&gt; Right now it is more like ethernet, our early internet, which was rate limited to about 5k requests per second. These are called broadcast networks. Bitcoin is building the lightning network, which is akin to tcp/ip, that is the protocol that our modern day internet is built on. This will allow bitcoin to scale to 3.2 million transactions per second. It will be out performing the banking industry by throughput and energy use.

It is interesting that at first you said that bitcoin will replace the whole banking industry while using less energy and here you are saying that you need to build on top of bitcoin (so its no longer just bitcoin) to replace the banking industry. What is also interesting is that now you are saying that lightning network, a technology that is being developed for the soul purpose of increasing bitcoin throughput, will replace the whole of banking industry and not just simple transactions which is not the only think that the banking industry does. Also, lightning network does nothing to lower bitcoins energy needs and just adds its own to the equation.

"What are its core deficiencies? I just gave you 2 credible answers for the deficiencies you listed earlier. There are thousands of developers constantly improving the network as we speak. 

BTC is used by tens of millions of people both to transact and as a store of value. Many of these people are unbanked and have zero access to traditional banking infrastructure. Bitcoin has a market cap of over $1 trillion dollars and is finding its way onto the balance sheet of major institutions, many of which with a history of being financially conservative. The narrative that Bitcoin is only used for illegal activities is untrue and outdated. Untraceable cash is still the de facto currency of cartels and terrorists. 

Why do server farms in China make BTC illegitimate? There are server farms and mining pools all over the world participating in the Bitcoin network. None of these participants control Bitcoin or can realistically attack the network. 

It seems to me your pessimism is not reflective of what is happening in the real world. I see Bitcoin growing in use and value daily with limitless potential.",1614710187.0,-1

It's true there are mining farms owned by companies that have invested massively in hardware to be able to mine. Much of the BTC they mine is immediately sold on exchanges to cover operating costs. There are many mining operations around the globe and no one entity solely controls the creation of Bitcoin. If you wanted to participate today you can join a mining pool and see returns.

I don't think mining is an issue. There is still only a finite amount of BTC being created with each block that is mined. Nobody can indiscriminately create more BTC and there is a cost for every mined coin. This is much different than the FED being able to open a computer and add a zero to the end of a number to poof USD out of thin air.",1614711552.0,1
"I would like to point out that computing for a bitcoin block is not a ""pointless task"" as you say. The reason for the energy consumption is for securing the block, and the blockchain as a result.

For the sake of explanation, a ""block"" in the bitcoin blockchain contains the following relevant pieces of data:

* Set A: the computed hash(or ""fingerprint"") of the previous block's Set A, several transactions, a timestamp, a nonce(some random number), the block ""target""/difficulty, and some other pieces of data.
* Set B: the computed hash(or ""fingerprint"") of the data in Set A.

The ""target"" difficulty basically states the requirement for Set B. It specifies the number of 0s the computed hash should start with. This ""puzzle"" is what is being solved. Within Set A, the previous block hash and the ""target""/difficulty are all known by the network, and is a given/constant value at that block level as specified by protocol/consensus rules. Due to this, the computer that wishes to secure this next block will need to ""play"" with the other pieces of data in Set A(transaction records, timestamp, nonce, etc.) in order to come up with a Set B value that is acceptable given the ""target"" value. This is hard work, even for computers. However, once that combination of data yielding an acceptable hash value(starts with a certain number of 0s) is found, it's very easy to verify across the network. Each participating node in the network simply receives both Set A and Set B from that successful ""miner"", and can verify in a flash that the Set B value is indeed valid, resulting to a newly secured block. At that point, the ""mining"" process starts all over again.

Based on this information, it should be clear how that energy/work is spent on security. Any bad actor that wishes to manipulate/change the Set A data(mostly transaction data) in that block would need to expend around the same amount of energy the entire network spent in securing that block. However, even if that attacker does get to solve a new Set B value, that value should be present in a newer block's Set A(which is very likely to be solved already by the time the attacker succeeds), which would result to the attacker needing to also solve for that newer block's Set B, which again will likely be already in an even newer block's Set A(and so on). Thus, resulting to blockchain security.

As an example of how secure the blockchain is, check out [https://fork.lol/security/chain](https://fork.lol/security/chain). At time of posting, assuming global bitcoin mining is stopped and all involved hardware/energy is instead focused on rewriting/redoing a transaction from the first block, it will take around 600 days of constantly expending today's current bitcoin mining energy consumption.

All this information is over-simplified by a lot of people, especially by the media. The bitcoin network really doesn't transfer value through mining. The mining process simply incrementally secures transaction records from all that uses the network.",1614712793.0,1

"To generate new cryptocurrency, the currency has to be “mined” by computers. What this means is that people get very powerful computers to transactional calculations. This allows the currency system to run “decentralized” and in return, the computer that did the transactional calculation gets rewarded with a small amount of the currency. 

What this means though, is that Bitcoin miners are literally trading electricity for Bitcoin. The computers do nothing but mine Bitcoin and they use a lot of power in the process. That power is generated by electric power plants who have to pollute in order to make that power.

"1. The amount of clean energy used in bitcoin mining is substantial, and increases daily.

2. Diminishing returns for mining are built into the bitcoin network, providing huge incentives to use cheaper (cleaner) energy.

3. The bulk of the hashrate coming from mining is centered in China, in areas where energy infrastructure was overbuilt, and uses surplus electricity.

4. Bitcoin mining monetizes electricity that’s already been produced, and would otherwise be wasted. This means that stopping the mining in these areas would literally have zero impact on emissions, even where the electricity source is coal.

5. All of this research uses national, rather than local or even provincial data, which massively skews output.

6. Much of this research is funded by establishment sources (financial and governmental) with a substantial interest in stopping decentralized finance from getting a foothold.

7. This research never includes relevant comparisons of other pursuits related to maintenance of financial infrastructure.

Bottom line, all of these stories making the rounds now already made the rounds 2+ years ago, were thoroughly debunked, and amount to propaganda.

"Bitcoin is a distributed consensus protocol. This means any change to the state of the bitcoin ledger requires votes to approve the transaction. Everybody that participates in the network gets to try to vote. 

If everybody can vote, how do you prevent bad people from voting for bad transactions? Well, as long as half of the votes participating in the protocol are not malicious, bad things can't happen.

OK, so how do keep one person from voting a billion trillion times? Voting requires a proof of work.

That proof of work? Made up math problems. The other folks in the network accept your vote if it correctly solves some made up math problem.

Now that means how many votes you get depends on how fast you can solve these made up problems. More hardware, more votes. But hardware costs money, so it has the effect of making sure no one person or group has enough money to buy enough hardware to overpower half the network. The hardware cost to generate half the network's votes is probably billions of dollars. 

Keep in mind that there's no intrinsic value in the stuff that bitcoin does. Solving these math problems is literally busy work just to make sure nobody can vote an arbitrary number of times without spending an arbitrary amount of money.

Everybody that is participating in the bitcoin network are all just agreeing to play by the same rules. And the value of a bitcoin is just whatever folks are willing to pay for one.

And that's the definition of a currency.

Part of that voting process and that made up work process? The protocol has rules about what kind of transactions everybody will agree to accept for transaction types that *create* new bitcoins. This process is called mining (mining isn't the only thing that requires voting). If you try to solve a made up problem as your proof of work for generating a new bitcoin that is too easy, the rest of the network will not vote for your transaction, so it doesn't work.

This is how bitcoin automatically rate limits how fast new coins are introduced - the proof of work that finds new bitcoins has to be hard, so it only happens a handful of times per hour.

"What is a store of value?  
  
The first thing is that it can't default. Companies and bonds fail that test. Fiat currencies do as well, although many, like the USD, are in no danger of that currently, despite debt levels. Bitcoin passes, but only if you don't consider legislation or technological risks to it to be default risks, which I'm fine with. Gold cannot default, it carries no debt.  
  
The second is that it has intrinsic value. Bitcoin falls that test. You can't do anything with it if nobody wants it. It's just a SHA key. Gold can be turned into jewelry or adorn a church, it doesn't need to be resold. It can be used as it is, rather than just sold. Equities and bonds notably pass this test because they generate income. Fiat currencies fail this test.  
  
The third thing would be a liquid market. Bitcoin fails that too. It's actually quite illiquid, which is one of the reasons it is so volatile and why fans like it (they call it limited supply). Notably, bonds and equities pass this test, although there are huge bid ask spreads on some illiquid ones. Gold can be traded anywhere in the world, including ""off shop"" because the value is known and accepted everywhere. Of note, the USD is the most liquid asset in the world. And this is where competitors other than silver and gold fail. Wood, for example, just isn't very liquid. You can't buy it in America and sell it in China unless you are at scale. If you buy wood from Home Depot, you can't resell it as is for anywhere close to the same price, it is illiquid, and you are stuck with it. That's because all other commodities are not money, like gold and silver are.  
  
Fourth, you want price stability. Bitcoin fails that as well. I probably don't need to explain this, but I'll add that equities don't pass this test. Fiat currencies can be debased, so this is where they fail in the long run. Gold is the prime example throughout history of this.  
  
And fifth, and most importantly, it has to be a terminal asset, one that won't go to zero and can be held indefinitely. Bitcoin is going to go to zero eventually, which is inevitable, so it massively fails that test. Equities are terminal assets. Bond ladders can be, although the bonds themselves generally are not. When I said the long run about fiat currencies, this is why. They can be stable for a long time, but inflation will eventually catch up. Gold, of course, is a terminal asset. You wouldn't want to hold bitcoin indefinitely as it's value is in greater fool theory and at some point you run out of fools and the price collapses to zero. You can make money in the meantime, which is true of all pyramid schemes, but you still have to cash out before the hot potato explodes.  
  
It's just not a store of value. Gold is. The same could be said for silver on all counts, but that's the only other asset class that passes. Bitcoin fails miserably. It is a worse store of value.",1615311864.0,-1

"The only leap you need to make to understand it is a “one-way” mathematical equation. Like you can add up the digits of your phone number and get a result, but using that result, you can’t back out the original digits. You can easily verify if a phone number is potentially the one you started with by adding up the digits and comparing the sum, but you can’t go backwards. 

Now I say “potentially,” because there are thousands of possible phone numbers that add up to the same number, and you could come up with another one that works fairly easily. This is where the mental leap comes in. Using cryptographic methods, it’s possible to have an equation where the *only* way to fine a phone number that works is to simply guess every possible number. Maybe a hand full of different numbers will produce the same result, but that’s a handful against hundreds of thousands of possible combinations. The result here is called a “hash” of the original data. 

Similarly to before, once you have the right answer, everyone can verify you got it right easily. It takes thousands of calculations to eventually guess the right answer, but just one to verify. 

So with Bitcoin, every ten minutes, computers around the world take the transactions that took place over the last 10 minutes (which are just numbers in a table essentially), add another transaction to the end that says “I get all the transaction fees”, and then add another random number. 

The goal is to take the hash of this bunch of data and hope the result comes out to a certain number. If it doesn’t, you change some of the random data at the end and try again. It could take hundreds of millions of tries to get the right number. This is most of what the computers are doing and what we call “mining.”

It’s a race because whoever comes up with the right combo of inputs to get that specific hash output “wins.” They can share their result and everyone else can verify it quickly making it official. The official ledger will now say that they got the transaction fees, and everyone will start competing for the next 10 minute reward.

This competitive nature means that whoever has the fastest computers is more likely to win the race every ten minutes. The algorithm also requires that the end hash result be an increasingly unlikely number so that it requires more guesses to find. This number is adjusted at the end of every 10 minute batch to keep the batches at about 10 minutes. So no matter how many computers compete, only one prize is awarded every 10 minutes.",1615311979.0,1

"How much programming do you know? It’s actually not particularly complex if you know what a hash is. If you don’t I can maybe explain that too.

So, starting with a hash. A hash basically a way of taking some arbitrary data, doing some math to it, and producing a fixed length “digest”. A checksum is a sort of simple hash. Take a long number, and keep adding digits until you get one digit.

    123    -&gt;  6
    123456 -&gt; 21 -&gt; 3
    456789 -&gt; 39 -&gt; 12 -&gt; 3

Any length number always produces a single digit checksum, and the same number always produces the same checksum. You see these get used at the end of account numbers to prevent typos. The only valid account numbers are the ones which end in a valid checksum.

Hashes in computer programming often serve a similar role. You can take some file, do some math, and generate a hash. Then, if you send the file off along with the hash, others can confirm the file has not been modified.

Now imagine I told you that the only valid bank account numbers were ones that had a checksum of 1. How would you find a valid account number? You would probably just start writing down account numbers, calculating the checksum, and then trying again. You would “brute force” the problem. This is essentially how proof-of-work works.

Unlike a checksum, cryptographic hashes are generated by complex enough math that there is no predictable pattern. When the blockchain algorithm says the only valid blocks are ones which result a hash that starts with nineteen zeros, there is only one way to produce a valid block: try over and over and over again. You add some random number to the block’s data, hash it, see if the hash starts with nineteen zeros, then try again.

This scheme essentially turns computing power into a lottery ticket. The more computing power, the faster you can calculate hashes, the more chances to find a valid block. This is important to bitcoin, because if you can distribute who gets to decide what the next block looks like, then no one party can take over and rewrite everything. Using computing power as a lottery ticket is a way to randomly distribute block authorship without any central authority.",1615312364.0,-1

"&gt; Here's the part I'm still not grasping. So it's perfectly possible for someone to control votes via this method? 

Yes. Bitcoin is an example of a specific type of Distributed Consensus Protocols called Byzantine Distributed Consensus, and this problem you've mentioned is a fundamental property of Byzantine Distributed Consensus systems.

The system only functions correctly if at least half of the actors (half of the voting power) in the system are non-malicious, and there is no way to design a protocol that reduces that burden.

&gt; Countries have billions. Very small groups of wealthy elite have billions.

And indeed, if they it to be worthwhile, they could make a shot at getting a faulty transaction committed and overpower the rest of the network.

Thr trouble is, such an action is somewhat self defeating. If you try to overpower bitcoin and commit malicious transactions, people will stop using bitcoin because they don't want to use a broken system. So all of the bitcoin you just stole losses it's value, and now the financial value of your actions is reduced.

"Printed money has dozens of security features that utilize ink on top of the money not being paper but cotton and linen blend.

Physical money requires a long logistical chain with fuel being used multiple times to transport each component to where it is produced. The security features are added at different points in the process and requires different types of ink and ribbons which all require factories to produce.

Money also doesn't have a single point of printing cost because, as you should know from looking at the date on your money, paper currency doesn't last that long.

The longest on average paper currency lasts is 9 years which is $100 or $50 bills. $1 bills stay in circulation less than 2 years, on average.

Visa transaction vs bitcoin is still not how you would compare it either. The bitcoin cost includes all the security features of the coin as well as it's creation. I can't find how much Visa spends securing their transactions or the support teams that perform it but because in most countries credit card companies bear the risk of fraud it is likely a big chunk of mo ey and resources.

"""Bitcoin transactions are not equivalent to Visa transactions. They are different in both form and substance.

First of all, Bitcoin and Visa are fundamentally different systems. Bitcoin is a complete, self-contained monetary settlement system; Visa transactions are non-final credit transactions that rely on external underlying settlement rails. Visa relies on ACH, Fedwire, SWIFT, the global correspondent banking system, the Federal Reserve and, of course, the military and diplomatic strength of the U.S. government to ensure all of the above are working smoothly.

Any energy comparison must take the above into account – including the externalities from the extraction of oil, which implicitly backs the dollar. As those who make this comparison inevitably fail to mention, the dollar’s ubiquity is partly due to [a covert arrangement](https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/) whereby the U.S. provides military support to countries like Saudi Arabia that [agree to sell oil exclusively for dollars](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-26/is-bitcoin-mining-worth-the-environmental-cost).

"Plenty of people can and do articulate it, but most people choose to ignore it in favor of the easy route of calling it a fad or a bubble or a Ponzi. I challenge you to explain the entire internet to somebody that has never used it. Imagine doing that in the early 90s. That is where we are now with bitcoin. There are over a billion people on the planet that live in countries experiencing hyperinflation. People are burning bags of their currency cause it is literally worthless.

Bitcoin requires really hard encryption work because that's how it stays secure and protects against fraud, for someone to commit fraud you would need more processing power than the rest of all miners combined. Also, bitcoin only gets harder over time, both because the blockchain gets longer, and because the encryption scales to current power. As computers get faster, Bitcoin encryption literally gets more complicated to compensate and stay secure. 

Bitcoin operates on the principle of ""proof of work"", it's literally like every computer must prove that they've wasted a sufficient amount of energy to get a seat at the table.

If people aren’t willing to part with their money, that means it has value, that value as a whole is mostly over inflated, because they aren’t really holding into them because the currency itself has value, they believe there is a superficial value in it. The value of a quarter itself is still only 25c, which is worth way less now than it was when the program started. Even the superficial value is limited, as SO MANY people collected those, they are very common. Which means they don’t really have much superficial value either, except in very specific cases. So it’s a facade of value both technically and superficially.  Right now people are holding onto crypto currency because they believe it has value, which is what gives it value in two ways. The believe it has value alone gives it value, as well as its limited circulation gives it a higher market value. The fact that you can’t directly spend it many places also kinda helps it keep value. It also seems to me the exchanges seem to be keen on maintaining the value of Bitcoin specifically because many of them have you convert others to bitcoins to cash out.

It's hard to fathom, but, electricity has to be used when it's made. The same time. What is the plant to do during the night?

They have to ramp down, despite no beneficial reason, in order to load match. This reduces the life of the equipment, raises maintenance, increases cost of operation.

Battery technology can't handle such large swings. It's not feasible. So, say you could make some power sink, a variable power sink, which absorbs that energy and reduces the stress on the power plant.

That's bitcoin mining. Sure, there might be a better use but they don't exist. Or are infeasible currently. We don't have good enough power sinks.

Bitcoin mining primarily uses stranded energy sources and inflexible sources. Nat gas plants have flares for this reason. Now there's an economic incentive to use that stranded energy that would be wasted regardless.

Ever heard of the duck curve? Caused by this exact same scenario except with solar? Bitcoin can mitigate that and encourage more renawbles to be implemented because the variability problem is being addressed.

Bitcoin does use energy which would otherwise be used for normal use, however, the excess demand that bitcoin places on that variable demand is accelerating renewable adoption.

Securities trading is already hardly regulated. The SEC is a joke in the finance circles. They're in the same boat as the IRS.

&gt; Isn’t there a fee for Bitcoin transfers?

There is a fee for wire transfers as well and it's very comparable to BTC transfer fees right now; as well as a (generally) 2.5% markup when transferring between currencies. For me that would be exchanging Euros and Pounds for USD which I am forced to do. If all commerce happens in bitcoin, or whatever currency ends up coming out on top, that 2.5% markup ceases to exist.

&gt; But the most pressing question is this, why would future, or present for that matter, applications make bitcoins appreciate in value?

It's just supply and demand. As more people start using it, the demand goes higher which will take the price up with it. We know the supply is limited so its value can't be eroded by just printing some more. At some point it will stabilize within a certain range. For example, the USD fluctuates between $1.2-$1.5 CAD. The 2008 recession being an extreme outlier when it fell below $1. Once that price is reached, and nobody knows what it is, it will stabilize and stay within a range barring any extreme outlying events.

Proof of stake is in its infancy by comparison. Proof of storage is clever, but it would inevitably devolve to the cost of electricity plus some overhead for keeping drives running in datacenters.

In short, people WANT to be able to make digital transactions privately and without censorship that we have with current banks and payment processors.

If we allowed banks to preserve privacy (except when served with a warrant) rather than forcing them to forward all transactions over $10,000 to the federal government (plus anything they subjectively find ""suspicious""), and had a banking option that didn't cut off users with no warning or explanation (as banks routinely do today, for example if you buy cryptocurrency through the bank), people wouldn't have much interest in cryptocurrency.

No, of course you don't, because you're not stupid and you understand that there are different levels of risk.

You're picking apart one word I used without addressing my point that as it stands, Bitcoin can't be used for the same purposes as money. The IRS certainly won't accept it to pay taxes. That means its value derives almost solely from demand, and that can be very dangerous. You might say that's how stocks work but while stocks can be largely driven by demand, they have a money-producing company behind them so while the stock price may deviate as a result of speculative investment (which is why they are often referred to as ""undervalued"" or ""overvalued""), there is an underlying ""fair"" price the value is tied to.

With Bitcoin, there is no ""fair"" price. While the value of Apple stock will stay roughly the same as long as people continue buying iPhones, the value of Bitcoin depends on whether people continue to dump money into it. I bought into Bitcoin at $250 so I'm obviously extremely happy to see it doing so well, but I treat it like a meme.

I'd bet that not a single person has paid their taxes in bitcoin.

&gt;It's just supply and demand.

But why would an immaterial concept, infinitely splittable, behave like any other commodity with regards to supply and demand?

&gt;As more people start using it, the demand goes higher which will take the price up with it.

That seems like a feedback loop, resulting in the price never stablizing, and therefore less people will use it as a currency.

&gt;Once that price is reached, and nobody knows what it is, it will stabilize and stay within a range barring any extreme outlying events.

What do you base this on? There is no guarantee that it'll ever stabilize enough to be used as a currency.

A single person flying a private jet around the world, and due to for example their celebrity status in doing so raises awareness and musters actual action everywhere they visit, that hypothetical situation would not be the problem, necessarily. \
Banks, wasting enormous amounts of resources, operating immensely expensive office complexes which aren’t particularly energy efficient, bussing around cash to and fro (which is ridiculously energy intensive), to just scratch the surface, that’s who Inwas getting at, for example. \
Any example I make is just condensed to give a general idea. Still not in the mood to write a dissertation on the content of a sarcastic remark I made. The aggressive reactions to it were a nice example of people being hypocritical due to the context. The blockchain technology, to give an example without much nuance, could very make the ‘money business’ a lot more efficient. Bitcoin’s PoW is most certainly not the way to achieve that. However, when Bitcoin is mentioned in the press it is used as a synonym for blockchain technology, and it is used to discredit all of it, not just BTC. \

Good. Gotta start somewhere.

&gt; There is a limited supply of coins that will ever be mined, which virtually guarantees that the value will go up.

There's also a limited supply of feces I can produce. What are you paying?

&gt; That's called deflation, and you never want a currency to deflate because it incentivizes hoarding rather than using. Most currencies try to inflate slightly.

Inflation also punishes savers and rewards borrowers. It incentivizes consumption for consumption's sake. The result is a throwaway society.

You only don't want a currency to deflate when your entire financial system depends on it inflating. Bitcoin represents an alternative outside the traditional system.

&gt; It's also terrible for transactions. The entire network has a limited number of transactions that can happen in a span of time.

On the base layer, yes. See Lightning for a Layer 2 example. Some people might even prefer custodial services. As long as you understand the counterparty risk that's perfectly fine. And in that context, transaction limits of course disappear entirely.

"You're right on some fronts - because of how rapidly the tech is becoming mainstream, there's absolutely a bubble around things like NFTs. 

However, the underlying blockchain tech on which all crypto runs is, IMO, the future of computing and networking. People get so fixated on the idea of cryptocurrency as just digital dollars, and when you think of it that way, of course it makes no sense. Why would I use BTC to pay for something and incur a $20 fee when I can use Venmo or Apple Pay, right?

That's the thing though - you can't just look at them as digital dollars, you have to think of them more abstractly, as stores of value. Bitcoin is like gold - it has some limited practical use, but it mainly acts as a store of value because it's finite and energy/effort/resource-intensive to obtain. Ethereum, on the other hand, uses a blockchain upon which decentralized apps and contracts can be built and executed, and then paid for using the coin.

This enables decentralized exchanges, like Compound and AAVE, where I can deposit currency, earn interest rates orders of magnitude better than any savings account, borrow against my deposits without any risk of lending discrimination or some invasive background check, and earn an ownership stake in the exchange itself via COMP or AAVE tokens, which both have monetary value based on the value of the exchange, but also give you voting rights when it comes to governing decisions of the exchange.

According to CryproCompare's built-in calculator automatically set to track the highest margin coin, Crypro on a dedicated system will earn about £0.038/$0.05/€0.043 per kWh with a low-power declocked-1070 system. In the UK the minimum small-scale solar power tariff is £0.31 per kWh, feed in tariffs in America are set at around $0.15 per kWh, and in Germany the rate is €0.19.

So through most of the western world running crypto on renewable power you generate on-site is a net loss of between 66% and 90% compared to simply selling the power. And those are just the lowest rates for each nation, with many small scale systems able to claim much more directly through FIT's or via other intensive programmes such as offsetting programmes, carbon control programmes, and utility avoided cost programmes.

Even in the third world, there are many places where FIT's create the same situation. Uganda for example has a tariff rate of $0.362 per kWh

Since traditional credit card systems rely on trust, they don’t have to do any verification (at this level) of transactions, and subsequently don’t need to require computers to do unrelated math to prove a blocks authenticity.",1615331737.0,-1

"The cost of a Visa transaction is super, super hidden, and this article seriously misrepresents that.

Visa transactions are backed by the power bills of every debit cards processor, the power of every data center run by a bank supporting Visa Debit back end, the oil required to print the plastic cards and the energy to keep the lights and networks on at every single point of entry for Visa.  

Bitcoin lets you measure that impact, but you can't reasonably add up the hidden cost to maintain the Visa network.  

Why is Bitcoin so much energy?  Because it lets ANYONE contribute; the collective hashrate is spread across computers in people's closets and huge warehouses running mining operations, but it can be tangibly calculated, whereas the power required to run Visa, cannot.

AND, Visa won't let you sit at the table unless you play by their rules.


The points this article makes are decent, but there's a lot more to the story than Bill Gates' opinion of whether the resources are wasteful or not, and no one has yet done those calculations (because they're literally impossible).


""Hey [big bank], how much do you spend on power at your datacenter every month?""
*calls all banks supporting visa*
*calls all merchants with Visa terminals.

Don't believe the hype.  The global financial system is a mechanism for controlling power.  Google ""Large Cash Transaction Report"" and find the laws for your local country, if you don't believe me.  Bitcoin removes the power from the big banks, and they're appealing to your green-strings (remember when it used to be heart strings?).

Yeah, Bitcoin costs money to operate, but don't be fooled in thinking Visa is green friendly, because the inefficiencies in banks is MASSIVE, and they're way, way behind in what anyone would call ""green friendly"".   As an example, name a single bank that's carbon neutral; if you find out, ask if they're generating their own power, or PAYING to offset their footprint?  

Now, have you heard of anyone mining bitcoin off water power, or solar?  People are finding ways to mine without paying telco, and it's generally by applying new, green tech, which Banks aren't agile enough to implement.


Taking that into consideration, the actual footprint of bitcoin is less on the industrial power grid than this article would lead you to believe.


For those reasons, I find this article to be BS.

You could change the rules of Bitcoin to be more energy friendly but that would take a 51% agreement from all nodes and miners.

"&gt;You have to make a pretty decently sized HW investment to mine Bitcoin in a way that’s going to result in a meaningful income

That is precisely the point. PoW is designed to be a net zero game. Miners aren't supposed to make big profits with it. If it was ideal, miners would always spent exactly the cost in electricity that the mined bitcoin is worth. The algorithm is designed to approximate that. In PoW, miners are always scraping at the edge of profitability.

It is a way to get the fresh currency out into the world in a *fair* way. Basically you as a Miner can go and spent 100 bucks for electricity and get 100 bucks worth of Bitcoin - in a completely decentralized way, without buying it from anyone, it is newly created money. This is part of the original genius of the bitcoin system.

PoS turns that completely on its head. In PoS, fresh currency is created out of existing currency. So if I have 1000 bucks worth of a PoS coin and mine/stake with it, I just have a chance that I basically get interest on that money.

"I am not saying Bitcoin is good. I am a dev, and know how it works more or less in detail: PoW is a terrible idea. I was just saying the comparison isn't really relevant at all. But no, the encryption of bitcoin isn't expensive in term of power because that's how it stays secure (PoS cryptocurrencies stay secure with a crypto system that is magnitudes of degrees lighter in term of power consumption, because what you actually need in term of computational power to keep it secure is in fact relatively very low). It consumes that much because the way ppl can ""mine"" new coins is by having a race to who can do more processing faster... and so the difficulty is adapted in consequence. PoW is terrible, but PoW is not the only system that can exist.

Bitcoin mining doesn't get more complicated to stay secure. If you believe so, you didn't understand what is PoW, and you should research it some more. As said above, you need very little computation to keep a secure ledger, in fact. It becomes more complicated because people found ways to calculate the hashes faster (ASICS etc), and the difficulty adapts so that a block will take always approximately the same amount of time to be solved. In general, the difficulty settles so that the price it costs you in electricity with the most efficient hardware for the task, is approximately what you can ""earn"" in bitcoin, at the current bitcoin price - it's a complex balance - and that's how some ppl can make a profit mining. If they have access to cheap electricity, they win money. But most ppl will pay more electricity than they get in return.


PoS solves the power consumption issue completely. It doesn't solve the fact that the more coin you have, the more coin you will earn with time (which also means the first adopters have a chance to get stupidly rich, while late adopters will struggle). But hey, isn't it the same with every currencies, even fiat currencies?",1615338655.0,1

"POW as a concept is nice, but completely ignorant of reality.

The reality is that since bitcoin was more than 20$ per coin, it's been an arms race, where a handful of extremely wealthy individuals have maintained a massively disproportionate advantage to stay ahead of the curve. Asics completely decimated the game for the normal miner, and the difference just grew.

It's simple logistics. If mining is always profitable, having more mining power is more profit, eventually someone will always outspend everyone else and receive more profit. PoW already encodes that the rich get richer, because it puts no limit to the amount of money you can spend to get an advantage. For a long time the scam was that wealthy market leaders would build their own asics, run them until they were suboptimal, then sell them for costs that were barely breakeven to normal people who didn't know better.

You mention that block rewards should ideally even out to just barely cover the cost of electricity, but this makes it self defeating. If profit margins are too small, the incentive and risk of loss dissuade anyone but the most heavily invested from wanting to mine. Worse, if you actually take a step back, in this scenario is almost always a net loss to the miner when you consider ecological impact and suboptimal utilisation of resources.

People are competing with each other to find these validation numbers for new transactions and get new bitcoins as a reward. 

The validation number becomes harder to find the more people there are that are trying to find them so that new transactions take about ten minutes to be added to the list.

All those people spending electricity to find those numbers use up a lot of power, which is bad, but so far other methods of making sure everyone has a correct version of the list aren't good enough, so we are stuck with this giant lottery until they become good enough.",1615338848.0,1

I still don't think investing in crypto is a good idea though, because even if a currency did replace something like Visa, there's no guarantee it'll be the one you or I invested in, we can only rule out coins it can't be.

"Mining leads to increasing centralization of people attempting to gain more rewards and thus more units of consensus though. With bitcoin the only people who can participate in consensus now are entremely wealthy mining farms, which is what I meant by centralization of wealth.

It’s a classic economies of scale problem. More consensus you can get = more rewards you can get. So this dynamic leads to pooling of stakers and miner and thus centralization of a bunch of wealthy people dictating consensus.

"from what I understand(so I don't really know, it's just what I can gather), is that initially there was a need for some system that could create coins for distribution that would at the same time limit(to avoid inflation) their creation, and the system they came up with leads to the current problem. The system they came up with was to reward the people doing the blockchain validations with the new coins and to make it fair, have them compete(since it's not really too hard to validate the blockchain) for the coins in a semi-random way. The system basically involves solving a random equation(that as far as I know has no other social value) that is tied to validating the blockchain(note: solving the equation is an added step not intrinsically necessary to a blockchain, just added to help randomize who gets awarded a new coin), the first one to solve it gets the coins(AKA mining). The limiting factor is that there was a predetermined number of coins distributed every interval(and I think that  number drops over time to keep inflation in check) and so the the equation was designed to fluctuate in difficulty to insure only the predetermined number of coins are created every interval. As more participate in mining and the more powerful their processing power, the quicker the equation will be solved, so the equation self-adjusts to be more complicated in order to keep to the limit. This is the design ""feature"" that creates the current problem, the more people mining plus the processing power per person(as processors become more powerful), means the equation must self-adjust to be more difficult in order to limit the number of coins released(keeping to the set limit). And now there's more people mining and with stronger processors than ever before. This creates an arms race to keep throwing the most processing power at the randomly solved equations, which is worth it, as long as the value of the occasionally rewarded bitcoin pays the cost(energy bill) off. I don't see any reason why this must be the way things are, besides this seemed reasonable at the time of it's creation(when bitcoin was not very valuable and processing power seemed more limited, and so who would spend thousands of dollars to mine coins?) and there is so much money involved now that there is more incentive to not change it.

Moreover, different places have different sources of energy generation. For example, where I live about 95% of our electricity is generated from renewables, and will likely be 100% before too long, so the whole argument doesn’t even get off the ground.",1615341980.0,-1

"The statement isn't actually true though. A bitcoin transaction on its own takes effectively no energy at all. It is the mining process that consumes the energy, not the transactions. 

These bitcoin FUD articles always use the same types of calculations where they take the amount of energy required to mine a block at the current difficulty, and then divide that block by the average number of transactions.

That seems reasonable at first glance, but it implies that bitcoin can't scale without using up considerably more energy. But this is not true, because like I say, the energy consumption is completely separate from the transactions. If you increase transaction throughput by 10x, the energy consumption does not increase by the same amount.

"I appreciate the point of view. I’m not an economist either so I’m willing to stand corrected, but as I understand it, deflation v inflation is hotly debated within the economic space. In the end I recognize both have their costs and benefits. Of course no one will print an infinite amount of money, but the fed has said there is no limit to their money injection. They print money to stimulate the economy and raise rates to control the resulting inflation. It gets hard to raise rates though once the economy gets addicted to money injection without inducing a recession and so it spirals out of control in the long run. I stand by my viewpoint of money following the laws of thermodynamics. There are limited resources on earth so there has to be a limit to what money can buy. I put in my work, get paid as a store of my work. I can then release that energy at a later time in the form of spending, rewarding someone else with a store of their work. When money is inflated, the work I put in is devalued by whatever percent inflation is. This is why it is unwise to hold cash and instead we either spend it or we invest in real estate, gold, bitcoin, stock market, etc. Inflation is a hidden tax that unfortunately most affects those that cannot afford to invest. Money can’t be created without some work being put forth. Gold is backed by the energy to mine it (I’m sure we could even hearken it back to the universe creating it, but that hurts my head). USD is backed by the GDP, or work/productivity of US citizens. Bitcoin is backed by the energy used to mine it. Since money can’t be created out of nothing, it has to be backed by something. In USD case, if printing money outpaces GDP, then the created money is backed by future productivity. Sorry this is long. I do wish you the best!",1615346778.0,1
"There are some [misconceptions](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/bitcoin-environment-mining-energy-cryptocurrency-b1800938.html) as to how harmful mining is to the environment. From the article:

&gt; ""In Iceland and Norway, where nearly 100 per cent of all energy production is renewable, cryptocurrency miners are taking advantage of cheap hydro-electric and geothermal energy to power their machines. The low temperatures in the countries also help reduce costs by cooling the computer servers naturally.

&gt; Last year, the University of Cambridge's third Global Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study found that 76 per cent of cryptocurrency miners use electricity from renewable sources in their operations. This figure was up from 60 per cent from the same benchmarking study in 2018.""

&gt; ""In its current status, the infrastructure that supports the bitcoin protocol cannot be sustained, but the beauty of the protocol is that the incentive structure will force miners to adopt the cheapest form of electricity, which in the near future will be renewable energy,"" Don Wyper, COO of DigitalMint, tells The Independent.

&gt; ""I think the latest University of Cambridge study is misguided, as bitcoin is acting as a 'digital gold' and therefore should be compared to the energy consumption of other store-of-value-assets... The gold mining industry consumes 475 million GigaJoules worth of electricity annually.

&gt; ""I personally believe climate change is one of the most important issues in our world today, but people who say bitcoin will lead to even more environmental destruction don't understand that bitcoin is actually acting as an accelerant to helping our environment.”

The takeaway from the article is yes, crypto *does* consume a lot of power, but so do similar industries, and the nature of crypto means it's trending towards more renewables. God knows how much power is used worldwide every day just to play video games, yet you don't see people complain about that, and you rightfully shouldn't - the problem isn't how we use our energy, it's how we generate it.

"It’s like that due to coin price, the block reward, and total hash rate. Bitcoin could just as easily run on a few dozen CPUs and pull less than 3,000 watts, but current economics prevent that. The current price with the current block reward make it profitable to burn so much energy with current hardware that energy consumption is so high. A mechanism called block difficulty regulates the speed at which blocks of transactions are confirmed. As hash rate increases, so does the difficulty to keep blocks coming every 10 minutes. If hashrate falls, difficulty eventually re-targets to match and bring block time back to 10 minutes, and does the same when hashrate increases. Chip efficiency, coin price, and block reward dictate how many miners are running. The more money each watt can make, the more miners come online. 

Basically, Bitcoin is still in its gold rush days. Another 8 to 12 years will start showing a decrease in energy consumption as the block reward dwindles, unless a combination of higher coin price and more efficient chips outpace the drop in rewards. 

There is also a practical need for a high hashrate, and that is chain security. Higher total hashrate makes attacking the network much more difficult and expensive, which is where Bitcoin derives a lot of its value. It’s a necessary evil, and most other stores of value are also rather environmentally destructive, sadly, and that is a core problem with the human psyche (at least under current narratives).",1615347275.0,-1

Your persistence does not make it true. 

&gt;The majority of cryptocurrency is not used for criminal activity. According to an excerpt from Chainalysis’ 2021 report, in 2019, criminal activity represented 2.1% of all cryptocurrency transaction volume (roughly $21.4 billion worth of transfers). In 2020, the criminal share of all cryptocurrency activity fell to just 0.34% ($10.0 billion in transaction volume). 

&gt;According to the UN, it is estimated that between 2% and 5% of global GDP ($1.6 to $4 trillion) annually is connected with money laundering and illicit activity.

It arguably does hurt the middle class too lazy to invest their money, but the other side of the coin there is that if there is deflation it can be good to just sit on money instead of investing it which potentially causes recession. Also the amount of work humans as a whole can do and what they can create has grown tremendously over time. If you can constantly make more out of the same natural resources it doesn't matter that they are limited. Productivity is also a big driver of value and has increased over time.

"Bitcoin is too slow to ever function as a widespread currency. Even right now, one usually has to wait 1-5 blocks before their transaction is confirmed.

Compare that to Litecoin, which adds a block every 2.5 minutes. Litecoin transactions can usually be fully confirmed before a Bitcoin transaction gets 1 confirmation. There are some promising PoS coins that are even faster yet. 

If Bitcoin were to become the crypto of choice for most transactions, the increased price would increase mining, but block difficulty would temper most of the increase in energy consumption.

"""Code is law"". Remember that?

That got dropped pretty damn quickly when the DAO hack happened.

Top comment in the subreddit at the time was (paraphrased): ""I lost money on a buggy smart contract. Can I get a hard fork as well?"". A tongue in cheek response but he made his point.

And we were right back to ""one rule for us, another for everyone else"". Not ""code is law"", not ""what you put on the block chain will be executed, so make sure you get it right"". Nope. The ""wrong people"" lost money, so we hard fork. And fuck everyone else that needs/wants this. We're more important than you.

This is a huge part of why I exit fiat (one rule for us, another rule for you), and then I see a coin which I felt had some value and promise just take a rule out of the unethical playbook of government backed central banking.

Unacceptable.

I held ETH during that time. I sold everything shortly after the hard fork. I held the ETC for a while longer, but when I saw that the market here just didn't have the same ethical stance I did, I sold that too.

So yes, I'm perfectly happy for ETH to fail because it doesn't deserve to succeed. It's proven itself to just be yet another shitcoin, where the rules are overridden when the wrong people lose money due to the code they wrote being buggy, which goes massively against my morals.

Plus all the other bits I mentioned which everyone seems to ignore, and I was mostly ignorant of at the time.

If it had been a *fundamental protocol failure* (every single smart contract being affected due to Ethereum execution bug, for example, not due to the contact itself), similar to what Bitcoin suffered, it would have been **just about**, and only just, acceptable, to fork to fix the problem. Bitcoin pushed the absolute limit on that one, one inch further and it would be relegated to shitcoin status as well.",1615352979.0,-1

"That calculation doesn't make any sense though. Like I said before, the energy usage comes from mining, not transactions.

If your calculation made sense then it would imply that if the number of transactions on the network went up by a factor of 10, then the energy used by the network would follow it. But this is not how it works. Miners expend energy in order to create new blocks on the chain, and are rewarded with bitcoin if they successfully solve the hash puzzle to create said block. When they create this block, they fill it with as many transactions as they can and also receive the transaction fees. By this point, the energy has already been spent - and the transactions have nothing to do with it.

That is why if the network were scaled to allow greater than 7 transactions per second on the base chain - or if people use 2nd layers like the lightning network, you can scale up to millions of transactions per second and the energy used is the same (energy use may go up or down due to price/demand of bitcoin, but has nothing to do with transactions really).",1615353807.0,1

"I enjoy gaming as much as the next person, but what you are suggesting here is that because you like gaming it is ok, but because you personally don't see the same value in bitcoin, it is not.

Our society does not allocate energy based on virtue, but rather by free market forces. Whoever wants energy pays the market rate, and gets to use it on whatever they choose.

If we start allocating based on virtue, you can quickly make an argument that anything which isn't essential shouldn't be allowed, and that would include gaming and a whole host of other things. Communist rationing basically.

My point isn't that gaming is better or worse than bitcoin, but rather that they have to be treated the same.

Also as an aside, there is a limit to mining. The more people that mine, the more difficult the hash puzzle, the more energy you need to buy to feed into the system. This lowers the profitability of all miners and means that either the price of bitcoin goes up, or the number of miners goes down. The price of bitcoin has a ceiling somewhere (although probably way higher than it is now), and that means mining energy use has a ceiling as well. Plus, 90% of all bitcoins have already been mined, and once we reach 100% the number of miners will probably go down permanently until it rests at an equilibrium where the remainder can still profit off of transaction fees (which incidentally probably means that transaction fees on the base chain will rise over time).",1615354613.0,1

The 0% interest we've seen the past decades is one direct consequence of that, which makes it pretty much impossible to buy real estate anymore, because people choose that over their foreign currency to store value. With Bitcoin, you can store value without taking away anyone's place to live.

But you're right, it's all very vague right now. It's hard to predict how bitcoin plays out, because it's so little adopted.

"You're touching on quite a deep rabbit hole there.

The short of it is, as designed by the creator; your ""checks"" would be instantly accepted by the Bitcoin network, and the deposit on the receiver's ""account"" would be acknowledged in the next block; it would cost too much for someone to cheat and make your ""check"" bounce or get cashed into someone else's ""account"". So yeah, if we were talking about the original Bitcoin, transactions are as good as instant, thought technically, they would only be officially permanently recorded after about 10 minutes on average.

The rabbit hole is that what most people call ""Bitcoin"" nowadays, is actually an impostor; it's a really long story, but the gist of it is the people behind the Dollar, credit card companies etc, people that would be threatened if they lost the monopoly over the world's money system, managed to infiltrate the original main developer group (and several discussion sites), pushed out dissenters, exercised a massive and ongoing propaganda, censorship and disinformation campaign, and lots more shit, and the thing that most people nowadays call ""Bitcoin"" is actually a crippled copy of it, where your transactions are not guaranteed while it's not included in a block, and you either got to wait (up to 2 weeks) to see if you'll get lucky and get included on a block, or you gotta try to outbid other people, paying outrageous transaction fees (it was originally pretty much free to send bitcoins), and hope you don't get out bid; and people on the receiving end also can't trust your payment will actually be recorded after you issue your ""check"", because another detail the attackers sabotaged now encourages people to treat as valid new ""checks"" that pay higher fees to override previously issued (but not recorded yet) ""checks"" if they pay higher fees; so they essentially made it an official feature to be able to pay a bribe to make your own ""checks"" bounce and get replaced with new ""checks"" that may be paying someone else or just sending the money back to yourself.

I think continuing to have honest discussions about the technology and it's utility is important because it's not going anywhere. Now, perhaps Proof-of-Work is a dead model, but maybe not. We'll have to see how rbosut these networks are to attacks as they implement new technology and protocols.

Don't forget, for thousands of years the safest and most cost-effective way to store your wealth was to acquire gold, smelt it into bars, and lock it away in a vault and put men with pointy sticks in front of that vault. No one batted an eye at the horrible inefficiency of this process because it was functionally useful.

So when we get curtailed, we shut the turbines down. It anything bitcoin miners are creating demmand which is great for the power market. 

Fossil fuels as an grid level energy solution is fading. I can run a 100MW turbine site with 6-10 guys and I'd only be paying for parts and maintenance. Versus the cost of conventional power plant, where you likely have hundreds of people working, along with fuel costs, parts and maintenance; it's incredibly expensive. Climate issues aside and just from a cost standpoint alone, mixed renewables make more sense.  Profit margins are way higher for everyone involved with renewables.

And I know what you're going to say ""but they're not accepting crypto! You're just converting it to USD and they accept that as payment!"" to which my reply is many fold:

1) What's the difference to the end user? I know you don't know, so I'll tell you: There's a small transaction fee, and that's the downside. The upside is you have more control over crypto than you do dollars you have sitting in the bank. You can gain interest on it, and unlike the US dollar, its value isn't plummeting by the day. You can lend it on DeFi and make your crypto work for you. And I know you're not familiar with this stuff, but the sooner you learn about it, the better off you'll be.

2) Yes, some of these will actually support merchants getting paid in the crypto of their choice... Namely the patent from Square. I'm not sure which others will support it right off the bat, but they certainly won't be the only one.

3) It'll only be a matter of time until merchants skip out the middleman converting crypto to USD and just take direct payment in crypto

This is all happening on a very rapid timeline. Adoption is coming. Within a year you'll be able to hold crypto and pay for stuff with said crypto anywhere that accepts credit cards.

&gt;&gt; Actually you know demand varies. And you know if you think about it, the power put into the grid is in fact managed or transformers will blow.
&gt;
&gt;That reference doesn't say what you think it says. You cannot have a generator of any kind produce more than it is designed to produce by sheer force of will. You cannot ""run the generators harder and meet the surge"" when the surge is more than they are designed to cover.

I didn't say you can run generators hover their maximum.  I'm saying you can run them at different rates to respond to demand.  It is just like your car.  You have fuel and you have generators, and you can run them to meet increased demand or back them off for less demand.  Obviously only within the capacity ranges of the generators.  As you must certainly ride in cars, trains, and buses, you must understand the range depends on the engines involved.

From the article:

&gt; The ability of a power plant to respond rapidly to variable grid demands is critical in today’s power environment with a high percentage of intermittent renewable power generation. Multiple small gas turbines allow the full plant load to be achieved relatively quickly from pushing the start button as the units can ramp up in parallel.

&gt; The ramp rates of small gas turbines typically range between 100 kW/second and 200 kW/second.


&gt;And regardless, they _did_ fail, so that doesn't matter. The failures of the state government to winterize the electrical supply is still to blame here.

&gt;&gt; Not true. Winterization requirements are set by region and expectations. If california or Minnesota got a month of 105 F temps, they would have failures that Texas would cruise through just fine.
&gt;
&gt;Ah, yes, a month-long 105F heatwave. This is relevant to our discussion of winterization. (Do I still need to tag sarcasm?)

To defend your view regulations can defend against very rare record setting weather events, yes you do.  You have to demonstrate that regulators not only defend against record setting cold weather, but as a principal they protect against all unusual weather.  I'd say that's an easier thing for you to defend than the idea that regulators ONLY worry about cold weather.  I was being nice.  But demonstrate they only are concerned or have a special focus on vastly rare cold weather please.  I withdraw any concerns of performance under hot weather.

&gt;&gt; Give me a reference for that. That regulators require blanket winter treatments without regard to climate and geographic region.
&gt;
&gt;I didn't say that regulations ""require blanket winter treatments"". Point to me saying that. Go on, do it.

You said:

&gt;&gt;The failures of the state government to winterize the electrical supply is still to blame here.


&gt;In the meantime, regarding the effectiveness of said winterization, we can derive from [how guidelines suggested by federal authorities in 2011 are now being made mandatory by the PUC, despite ERCOT's whinging,](https://news.yahoo.com/mandatory-power-plant-winterization-coming-043120717.html) that federal requirements for Texas would have been similar to those federal guidelines, and thus, would have been effective.
&gt;
&gt;But nice strawman. You go argue against that while I sit over here and watch, have fun.

We are off track here, as 40 year events always cause problems.  We will fix things now, but after a few decades and leadership changes, we will slowly slip into complacency again.  That's bad and it could be fixed but it doesn't change the fact that having a use for wind and solar that enables more capacity to exist can help make wind and solar less disruptive to a power grid.

Getting into a (likely partisan) argument about regulation doesn't change the fact that smoothing power production from renewables is a huge problem that Bitcoin mining might address in some cases.

&gt; You'd be surprised to learn that the majority of energy used to mine bitcoin is green.

Even if that's true (I've seen conflicting numbers), it's irrelevant. When the grid is not 100% clean, consuming green energy forces the grid to burn more coal/gas for the rest of the economy. Any additional energy usage, green or not green, directly increases carbon emissions.

Some people (typically no coiners) are unbelievably salty about how well Bitcoin operates and have a fetish for breaking it or trying to think up flaws in it, but those people tend to be the exact opposite of the kind of people who might be capable of breaking a secure hashing algo. Some people believe SHA-256 is already broken and the folks who did it just occasionally mine blocks from a laptop instead of a mining farm. That’s certainly what I’d do.",1615388944.0,-1

I’ll side with Satoshi every day of the week and twice on Sundays. Gigantic blocks serve only the miners and serve only to damage the protocol.

"Miners process everyone’s transactions. The only transaction they have that’s different from yours is the coinbase, which is the transaction they create to pay the self the block reward. 

When you send a Bitcoin transaction from your wallet, you include 3 things; the source (your address), the destination (their address), and the Tx fee (how much you’re willing to pay to have the transaction processed on the network). Your wallet probably sets the Tx fee for you, so you probably never have to think about it. Fees are calculated in terms of Satoshi per byte (one-hundred-millionths of a Bitcoin per byte of data your transaction weighs). And, more or less, the higher the fee, the faster your transaction is mined.   

Miners who get to create a block go into the mempool (the global list of unmined transactions), pick transactions, and then include them in the block. Blocks have a size limit to avoid people from just making massive blocks and inefficient transactions that make the blockchain too heavy.^1 If your fee is unreasonably low, you probably won’t be included in a block until the size of your transaction just happens to be the perfect size for some miner to finish a block after including higher fee transactions. If your fee is unreasonably high, you will probably be included in the next block.  

1. Big blocks discourage people from running full nodes (internet connected copies of the wallet/software that broadcast and share the entire blockchain and that validate incoming blocks and make sure everyone follows the agreed upon rules) because they need to have more storage and more data bandwidth, and, in turn, this allows big actors who can run massive data centers (think nefarious governments, financial powers, and massive corporations) and bad actors to try and manipulate the protocol as fewer and fewer people can operate a full node. This was the goal of the Bitcoin Cash scam. They wanted to break the protocol so they could centralize it and own it. They made billions but eventually lost that battle.",1615390111.0,-1

"The difficulty is done using a part of the software called the difficulty adjustment. It’s beautifully simple. Whatever the global hashrate was at a certain period in time (the total number of attempts being made per second at the math problem), the software updates the difficulty for the next 2,016 blocks to try and make it so that last hashrate would find a block approximately every 10 minutes on average. This means, when the difficulty adjustment is working properly (going on 11 years and so far so good!), the adjustment happens roughly every 2 weeks.   

But, more importantly, this means that if someone makes a huge jump in hashrate (like, for example, when we first built software to let you mine Bitcoin with graphics cards instead of a CPU, or when the first ASIC miners were introduced and the hashrate jumped exponentially overnight), the new difficulty only lets that jump burn the chain for a maximum of 2,016 blocks, and then the protocol slows back down so the rewards stay steady and  blocks come every 10 minutes. For day to day changes (mining farms turning on new mining rigs or directing power from this cryptocurrency to another, etc.), the difficulty adjustment is typically small (and can go up or down) and just keeps the network secure.",1615390635.0,1

"Except it doesn't stand on its own merrits.

Bitcoin is more expensive in transactions than normal banking with normal currencies. Both regarding cost as well as energy usage.

It's slower than normal banking at handling transactions than normal banking if you are using blockchain for everything. Plus it has a daily transaction limit.

It's only more secure than normal banking when using the blockchain for everything. And even then it has pretty big security drawbacks due to being decentralized (namely chargebacks not being possible, no error corrections, etc)

And it also makes fighting recessions a lot harder as printing more of it isn't possible and pinning it to another currency also isn't possible.


The only way to fix the first two is by using large banks with centralized pools that only equalize their debts against one another once or twice a day and use normal accounting between that. Doing this also gets rid of the entire additional security aspect provided by the blockchain.

So bitcoin especially and crypto more or less in general aren't better currencies than what already exists for a host of reasons. Which is probably enough to stop them from ever becoming relevant.

For one, in terms of block rewards, simple PoS is a literal rich-getting-richer protocol. The more you own, the more you get rewarded.   

Second, it’s just not been vetted enough on any blockchain with sufficient volume or value to be considered reliable. The Ethereum Foundation is great, and if PoS breaks, they’ll figure it out. But until it’s stress tested, it’s still too new to say “this works.”

Mixed consensus is the immediate future. Protocols that use different consensus mechanisms for different layers and purposes (e.g. using creditworthy permissioned nodes or trustless masternodes on layer 2 solutions on top of Bitcoin).

Funny how no one can ever state what they think is good about BCH without comparing it to Bitcoin, huh?  

And it might seem bit odd that you never, ever encounter a BCH supporter who actually understands even the fundamentals of how the protocol works. But the reason is because if you understand even the bare bones aspects of the protocol, you understand why BCH is just a scam and you understand why their hard fork failed so badly.

"lol. My take on Monero is a pretty common and uncontroversial one. It addresses a few narrow issues within Bitcoin that makes it more suitable for a few narrow purposes at the expense of economic auditability, verifiability (of transactions that you aren’t party to, which is of course the entire point of XMR), and an enormous degree of technical complexity.   

This complexity of the cryptonote protocol Monero is based on has been a problem for everything from auditability of the software, to implementing it into 3rd-party wallets and exchanges and other tools and protocols. The mechanism of consensus in XMR is also just not sustainable, and if the economics of the system outgrew its software, we’d have to see something else put in place. Because scheduled forks just aren’t sustainable.  

RingCTs, generally, are a problem, because their entire purpose is to obscure the state of the economy. So for those with concerns of the pseudonymity in Bitcoin, Monero introduces some marginal level of anonymity for Monero users. But the expense is that you need to have a degree of trust in the network. Where Bitcoin’s auditability makes it trustless.   

But I think a lot of people misunderstand and overestimate the “anonymity” of Monero, not realizing that you need to work hard and be very, very consistent and smart to avoid tools like Chainalysis from following your transactions (or just having some service provider who knows your details share them). If you buy Monero on an exchange and send it directly to another user, you have ZERO anonymity. Zero. In that situation, it’s really no different or better than pseudonymous currencies like BTC.  

My focus for the past 6 years has been on layer 2 solutions and on off-chain validation, which is something that makes Bitcoin’s auditability and immutability so valuable. This stuff just isn’t possible (by design) on a “privacy” chain like XMR.   

So, while I don’t think there’s some global issue with Monero, I think it’s practical and useful for a relatively small set of purposes and doesn’t have much use beyond that. I do think, if nothing else, it’s an awesome test case (and the most mature test case) for intentional obscurity in decentralized currencies.",1615396364.0,1

I'm greedy, so I would only pick the transactions with the highest tip. Other people might pick ones without a tip or low tip, there is no rule.

The real problem that I've maintained from the beginning is related to fossil fuel production driving climate change no consumers of energy like bitcoin.  Attacking the consumers of energy, regardless of your personal opinions, doesnt solve the problem.  It's like fighting the war on drugs by arresting the addicts and we all know how massively that has failed for over 50 years.  You cant fight climate change on the demand side, it can only be done on the supply side.",1615399699.0,1
"Another way to look at it would be in terms of money spent running the service. How much money does the world pay Visa for the services they provide? Since Visa is profitable, their revenue is more than enough to pay all their employees for their time (the human cost), on top of their energy costs, buildings, etc.

Looks like for Visa their revenue is $23 billion a year.

How much money do we pay Bitcoin miners every year?

Well, it's a little complicated since Bitcoin's value fluctuates so much. Now it's $50K/each, but it was a lot less last year. Currently a block rewards miners 6.25 BTC plus fees, and the fees in a block add up to 1-2 BTC depending on how much activity is going on. We could get fancy and write a program to put a price on every block based on the BTC price at the time it was mined and the actual fees in that block, but for reddit comment purposes I'll just guesstimate a year of activity at present rates of $50K/BTC * 7.5 BTC per block * 6 blocks per hour * 24 hours per day * 365 days a year... $18.3 billion a year.

Pretty close really.

If you're pro-bitcoin, you could make the argument that Bitcoin is out to replace not just Visa but AmEx, MasterCard, Chase and a dozen or more other institutions and I should add those up, too.

But if you're anti-bitcoin, you'd point out that Bitcoin currently isn't enabling even one 1/100th of the economic activity that Visa alone facilitates, and furthermore, that Bitcoin's expense gets higher the higher somebody believes a Bitcoin should be worth -- the ""to the moon"" dream of $1m/BTC would make that mining cost number balloon too. So it all depends how you want to look at it.",1615399803.0,-1

&gt; No, but people sending money for their relatives to use will do. And if its actually used as a currency which has now failed.

How has it failed as a currency?  You can still use bitcoin as a currency it just probably isnt a great idea because of local regulations that treat is as a security with a different tax liability and reporting requirements than regular cash.  There's already legislation floating around, at least in America, that would reclassify bitcoin purchases under a certain threshold opening up all cryptos for use as currencies.  Remittances is one of the bigger benefits of bitcoin, especially internationally, because people dont need a bank to use or receive it.  This is especially beneficial in countries without strong governments or banking services or strong currencies.

&gt; Terrible analogy. Of course you can. There are things called externalities that aren't priced in. The damage bitcoin is causing should be taxed via a carbon tax.

Wouldnt it be ironic that bitcoin would be the thing that adds value to a tokenized carbon asset?  The rest of the market has panned carbon cap and trade.  And no, you cannot fight climate change on the demand side.  There's nothing terrible about the analogy except that it proves how ridiculous the idea is of attacking sources of demand when the problem is related to supply.  It doesnt mitigate the issue.  Bitcoin mining is actually driving renewable energy build outs because its the cheapest form of electricity.  Maybe you didnt think about the fact that bitcoin miners will want to buy more renewable or move to places with large renewable capacity because it increases their profit.",1615401181.0,-1

Getting money onto an exchange and off exchanges takes more than 1 day for bitcoin. And you have to usually pay fees for these. The average bitcoin transaction cost is over $13.

&gt;How has it failed as a currency?

Scalability, stability and being a unit of account. It fails all 3. Even Bitcoin advocates have changed to 'its a store of value'. Its barely accepted and cannot be used in normal transactions.

&gt;Maybe you didnt think about the fact that bitcoin miners will want to buy more renewable or move to places with large renewable capacity because it increases their profit.

Bitcoin miners caused blackouts in Iran earlier this year. Every single unit of power used for the wasteful output of bitcoin could have been used for something else. Even if the whole world was green it would be using a disproportionate share of electricity because of its fundamental design features.

Its immoral and I know bitcoin advocates don't give a shit. Itd be better if you said, 'I don't care'.",1615401748.0,-1

Its not a small number, China has a ton of criminally underused hydroplants. They built dozens, and didn't build infrastructure to transport it, hundreds of miles away from any significant population centres.

No one stops them, if they want to set up a fertiliser plant in mountainous regions with bad roads and no educated workforce around for hundreds of miles, sure, go for it.

The benefit to bitcoin mining is that you can run a facility generating millions every month, with satellite internet and less than 5 people on site, practically anywhere. Not many other industries can do that. Some large mining companies are literally building green energy sources to increase profits.

Again for wasted electricity this isn't true, in anycase you could argue that bitcoin mining helps fund renewable energy companies with cash they otherwise wouldn't see, and develop further projects.


That's certainly the whole point, you can argue you think it's wasteful, and that's an opinion. But the process of transferring bitcoins miners 100% green, is much much easier than any other industry, due to the flexibility.

&gt;Mastercard announced crypto payments by end of year.

This about sums bitcoiners up. They don't care what people actually say. They just want to use any news to pump the price more. 

This is what mastercard said:

&gt;To be completely clear, not all of today’s cryptocurrencies will be supported on our network. While stablecoins are more regulated and reliable than in the recent past, many of the hundreds of digital assets in circulation still need to tighten their compliance measures, so they won’t meet [our requirements](https://www.mastercard.com/news/press/news-briefs/mastercard-s-principles-for-blockchain-partnerships/). We expect consumers and the ecosystem as a whole will start to rally around the crypto assets that offer reliability and security. It’s those very same stablecoins that we expect to bring into our network.

&gt;What are we looking for? Four key items.

&gt;First and foremost we need consumer protections, including privacy and security of consumers’ information — the same level of security people have come to expect in their credit cards. Next, strict compliance protocols will be needed, including Know Your Customer, a requirement meant to snuff out illegal activity and deception in  payment networks. Also, these digital assets must follow local laws and regulations in the regions they are used.

&gt;Lastly, people will want to use these digital assets for payments, so that is one of our criteria too. To reach our network, crypto assets will need to offer the stability people need in a vehicle for spending, not investment.

Bitcoin advocates completely misunderstand currency. And that's because the founder of bitcoin had  very rudimentary and crude economic knowledge. That's filtered down.

Currency is a tax credit.  At one time you could go to the US government and demand and get gold. You can’t do that anymore. What you can do with this is pay taxes to the government. Anything the government accepts for payment of taxes has value. If the government said a piece of paper is worth $100 for taxes, this will be worth $100. The government grants tax credits to many corporations. They are as good as money. Not only that, they *are* money. 

The government turns worthless pieces of paper into something very worthy. And that will always remain the case as long as governments are around.",1615413267.0,1

"Satoshi made it deflationary and gave it a finite supply cap and distribution halving for a reason.  Sovereign currencies become more more worthless over time.  They lose value.  This stimulates spending for sure because why hold something that continues to degrade in value?  The currency is only as good as the government backing it and in our case in the US that's backed by $21T in debt where the interest nearly outpaces our GDP.

When governments fail, the paper becomes worthless as we saw in Venezuela.  Sometimes, as we saw in Greece, the government then confiscates the deposits of citizens to pay back its debtors. 

That cant happen with bitcoin.  

Rocks have no inherent value, but for the people of Yap they served as currency because as participants they agreed the exchange had value.  It's simply an abstraction of value that participants have agreed on exchanging driving its price from $.003 to over $57,000 a coin over the last 10 years.

And it exists outside of any government.  It cant be inflated to nothingness.  It cant be confiscated.  It doesnt become worthless with the dissolution of some government.  It's paired to nearly all currencies.  Sovereign currencies are simply languages and with bitcoin you can translate that value instantly to nearly any local language.

"gold could be pressed into coins so it portable and it didn’t rust. 

Central banks are independant and have a mandate of keeping a currency from fluctuating.

Central banks are given a mandate to maintain inflation at a certain percentage by either raising interest rates or printing money. This system has been adopted by most countries which is why you no longer see regular occurrences of hyper inflation bankrupting every citizen. 

Bitcoin has no way of printing money if the currency fluctuates which is why bitcoin will never be stable. Stability is one of the key properties that make something viable as a currency. If i sign a contract to build a house for someone for $100,000, i need to be able to buy supplies and pay my workers assuming i’ll get the same $100,000 value at the end. if i finish a job and get paid half what i expected to make because the currency has fluctuated, i’m fucked.

- you can't easily send 12 billion dollars of cash to a private wallet in sub saharan africa with only an internet connection and access that wealth with 12 words on a piece of paper or through memorization(we call that a brain wallet). you can't do that with anything with other than bitcoin or block chain technology. no one can guess those 12 words from you either, that's why there's NFTs selling for millions of dollars now. The 12 word thing is called a BIP39 encryption key and that was made so normal people can safely store large amounts of bitcoin, very easily. it's more unique than a fingerprint - it's like a digital finger print.

- cash can be debased by local governments. local governments can end meaning your cash is valueless. as long as the bitcoin network is running, 1 BTC will always be 1 BTC. you have to realize that people used to trade it for free amongst each other for no monetary gain. after it started trading for a penny, it never hit 0 ever again and entire industries started developing specific hardware to power that network. this is not something that is going away IMO and we will see many governments come and go in the face of BTC.",1615426173.0,1
"The GDP of New Zealand is about 206 Billion dollars 
https://tradingeconomics.com/new-zealand/gdp

Argentina has a GDP of about 449.70 Billion dollars
https://tradingeconomics.com/argentina/gdp	

Bitcoin right now manages and secures the value of 1 trillion dollars, more than the GDP of New Zealand and Argentina combined.  Furthermore Bitcoin accounts for trading of 22 billion dollars of value per day on exchanges (which is done at a fraction of the carbon footprint of traditional securities and commodities, and isn't counted as part of Bitcoin's carbon footprint).

Bitcoin is currently transacting around 100 billion in the value of outputs from transactions per day.  

https://bitcoinvisuals.com/chain-output-volume-day

So in fact, Bitcoin's economic activity is significantly greater than New Zealand and Argentina combined right now. 

IF you believe anything that has carbon emissions should be stopped THEN please give me the complete list of everything we are doing that should also be stopped. For example: 

* Social Media (like Reddit) has a significant carbon footprint.  Stop it? or Keep it?

* Entertainment (like Netflix, concerts, sports) has a significant carbon footprint.  Stop it? or Keep it?

* Banking and Finance contributes about 30% to the world's GDP but is really just overhead on the actual economic activity that produces goods and services.  Stop it?  or Keep it?

* Meat production (like steaks and hamburgers) contributes greatly to carbon emissions.  Stop it? or Keep it?

In fact, Bitcoin is on its way to being far, far less carbon intensive than current banking and finance.  Why is it a hard stop then?  You really think we can just keep running our economy with a 30% overhead for just supporting economic activity?",1615427718.0,1

My interest in bitcoin is that its an immutable ledger that can not be defrauded and facilitates borderless transactions. It has hard coded economic policies in regards to its inflation rate while my government and many others are trying to print their way out of problems. The price swings are for now merely posing a money making opportunity that I am taking advantage of.

"Okay, so here's where it might get a little tricky.

Each block (the group of transactions) has a few constituent parts, 6 to be exact. We're only going to worry about 3 of them. Each block has a hash (a shortened copy) of the previous block's hash. Each block has what's called a nonce, or the solution to the puzzle. Miners adjust the nonce in their block to equal or be less than a set target number. This is very hard to do and probably is most analogous to buying lottery tickets as quickly as you can for the next winning drawing, but so are a bunch of other people.

Ok, so the important piece I think your question is about is the difficulty target. This is where the bitcoin network comes into play. Each block sets the difficulty of the next puzzle based on how long it took the miners to solve the last 2016 blocks, or around how fast they were being solved two weeks previous. The bitcoin client compares the target difficulty to the goal of a new block every 10 minutes or so. Based on this, the diffiulty target in the block changes. A lower target (more zeros in the target number) means it's getting harder. If it's taking too long to solve, then there will be fewer zeros, so it's a higher easier target, but it generally only gets harder.

Tl;dr - So, to try and be direct: the math problems come from the bitcoin network but there isn't one answer, more like trying to guess a number that's less than another number. They are not predetermined, but there is a generative process. The mining activity creates more mining activity in conjunction is with the bitcoin client's goals. If there's only one miner, the puzzles would be very easy I assume but it's the network of people mining that gives it value and added difficulty.

I am a wretched coder, so I can't answer your last question. Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a white paper about the code and stuff but it's way above my understanding. There are lots of smart people here with a much deeper understanding who I'm sure can give you a better answer, and who I invite to add or correct my explanation!

With a credit card or regular transfer I'd have protections. Not so with bitcoin. Never again. It wasn't even cheaper than using another service...

No one I've met has yet made a good argument for Bitcoin as a currency that can't be debunked very quickly. The only honest one that sticks is avoidance of tax or the ability to launder money/scam people. That's not a great selling point.",1615470842.0,1

It confirms that when you build a currency that is created by wasting power, people will go where the cheap power is. That's chinese coal.  And Bitcoin has no built in functionality to select for renewables.

You are also free to buy Bitcoin. No one is preventing you from doing so such as in the examples you provided. It’s not exclusively for the wealthy.

"&gt; And if bitcoin is a pyramid scheme, so is investing in anything else with a finite supply and expecting to be able to sell it to someone else for more money down the road.

Well you said it right there... you're *investing* in Bitcoin, you're not using it as a currency.  A currency which depends upon the whims of private mining companies whose interests are not ""support a global economy"", but are instead ""let's make as much *real* money as we can"".  By charging exorbitant fees for even the simplest of transactions. 
 Some $20 to $30 *per transaction*.  Yes, the government also charges a fee in the form of a tax, but that tax only applies to retail transactions and is a fixed percentage of the total bill.  I've never been charged a tax of $30 to buy a stick of gum, and I don't have to pay a fee to some outside organization when I pay the neighbor kid $10 to mow my lawn.  

You'll argue the fees will decrease as the number of transactions goes up.  Scaling.  Right.  But these fees can only go so low... supporting the blockchain requires intense computations that require both real-world capital and operational expenses from private companies whose sole motive is to extract as many fees as they can.  As described in this very post, the actual energy demands to support a single Bitcoin transaction are astronomical.  It's completely unsustainable and unsupportable in the long-term.  Just do the math, figure out how much energy would be required to support a blockchain doing every single financial transaction currently done in U.S. dollars.  I suspect your answer would be greater than the entire world's energy demand.  Does that sound like a feasible alternative technology to governments ""printing their way out of problems""?

The funny thing is, your solution to these problems, minimizing volatility compared to traditional paper currencies, will actually spell the death of crypto.  Because the VAST majority of Bitcoin owners are not in the game to use it as a daily currency.  They're all like you: they're there to make money off some other sucker willing to pay more real currency for the same bits and bytes that you did.  And if the price levels off, it's not an investment asset any longer.  People will realize their real money is tied up in something they can't easily exchange for goods anywhere, and that there are more lucrative investment vehicles they should get into instead.  And boom, game over.  Play the volatility game as long as you like, good on you for taking advantage of people who aren't day trading it.  But make sure you get out while you can... after all, you still need someone willing to be that sucker.",1615476079.0,1
"The definition of economic activity is pretty broad.  Outside of helping someone with their homework, or praying at a temple, about everything else involving money is in fact economic activity.

"Monero transactions are typically traceable, *with enough effort and time*. There are a handful of mechanisms for figuring out the real outputs in a transaction (ZMR and IR being the big two). These are long-known vulnerabilities and are even discussed on Monero’s known issues.  

But, again, the main things that sabotage anonymity of Monero use isn’t from the protocol itself, but from how a user uses it. If you’re not laundering/mingling the coin through multiple transactions, it’s not difficult to figure out where the coins end up or where they came from. Each transaction adds another degree of complexity to tracking outputs, but if you’re not working to preserve that complexity, you’re not benefitting from it. So if LE has a destination address connected to a crime, they can definitely walk back to a spending address with enough time and effort.   

If that spending address is associated with an exchange or a known address, that’s game over. Expensive, time consuming, and not perfect, which is why privacy coins like Monero are obviously better than pseudonymous coins like Bitcoin. But expecting automatic anonymity is a fool’s errand.  

There is also the concern with rogue nodes and logging nodes. This is all rumor and speculation, but, if it’s the case, with a sufficient network, the vulnerability shifts from the XMR protocol to simple internet network and device vulnerability. And we know that people *really* suck at OpSec and NetSec. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had to argue, even on panels with so-called network security professionals, that state level actors can see through VPNs, onion routing, and every other obfuscation technique we’ve created if they want to. There’s a reason cryptography experts make double or more what other developers make. It’s the only thing that currently exists that, when properly executed, can actually maintain a wall of privacy against a state level actor.  

If you’re playing with a few grand, auditability probably doesn’t matter. But for real investment and ownership at scale, auditability matters. Again, one probably doesn’t care about financial audit if they’re using Monero (and they probably consider the lack of auditability as a benefit). But it’s part of what makes Monero of limited use. It’s like poker chips. They’re great at the casino because you don’t need to play by the rules of money while you use them. And as long as you’re in Monte Carlo, you can use them like private money. But you can’t take them home and pay your wife’s boyfriend’s rent with them.  

Yes, auditable coins have limited green supply and tainted coins (Tx outputs that were involved in hacks or proceeds of crime, etc.), but we certainly haven’t seen any short supply of major coins like Bitcoin. There are millions of green circulating coins worth hundreds of billions of dollars, and there are millions more or uncirculated coins worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Most large transactions (say, $50M or more) involve off-chain/OTC brokerage of early mining rewards. And even on a small scale, if you’re concerned about provenance of coins, it’s easy enough and free or near-free to swap for green coins.  

Bitcoin isn’t used as a modern currency, it’s used as a store of value. It was never really intended to be used as a currency in the same way we use fiat, with trusted creditors and debitors and a system of tradeback. And for people who want to use a modern currency based on crypto, there are plenty of other options or off-chain ways to transact that benefit from both systems.  

So, again, Monero serves a purpose, but that purpose is limited. Bitcoin serves another purpose, and though also limited, it has many more of the characteristics that are necessary for a “mature” asset.",1615481502.0,1

"I feel like this article is a little misguided as NFTs are revolutionary as they help solve the problem of digital ownership. 

Literally imagine any digital asset that you purchase through an online service. For example, when you buy a game on Steam you do not own the game, Steam simply grants access to this digital resource. Similar systems exist for books or movies on Amazon or skins in League of Legends. With the point being that you don’t own these goods. You cannot resell these goods to someone else like you would be able to if you had purchased the good physically. 

NFTs help track the ownership of digital goods and prevent duplication through consensus on the blockchain. This allows people to carry there digital goods with them across platforms or sell those goods to other people. The implementations of this are as boundless as the ownership of goods in real life. 

An example application in the short term, you could create an entirely NTF back Magic the Gather like card game. Card tokens could be minted and sold on various markets to players just like real cards. These cards could then be used on any platform that could link to your Ethereum wallet to determine which cards you had access too and players would be able to independently sell and trade cards with each other. 

A more grounded application of NFTs are to use them to create digital versions of legal documents such as a deed to a house or a title to a car as they could be used to create a public chain of ownership that cannot be easily lost, doctored, or destroyed. 

A more futuristic look at NFTs could come with later advancements in virtual reality technology. If we get to a point where we have Ready Player One or Sword Art Online esk digital environment, personal ownership could become a problem as you wouldn’t want people finding some kind of item duplication glitch and ruining your in game economy. NFTs could be used to keep track of what items a player owned and it could allow them to bring items to different virtual worlds (assuming that those assets were supported). If this sounds to farfetched several companies are already getting in on the digital real estate space [Digital Real-estate boom article ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.coindesk.com/here-comes-the-virtual-real-estate-boom%3Famp%3D1) and that land is already worth millions of dollars, so I wouldn’t be surprised if those worlds later became the foundation for more fanatical worlds in the future. Further building on this idea, in the coming years there is no reasons that all of those art NFTs that have been purchased couldn’t be placed in those digital spaces to be shown off. Basically imagine VRchat on steroids. 

Also on the topic of emissions, NFTs do consume a lot of electricity due to the proof of work model. This will be fixed on the Ethereum network with the the switch to the proof of stake model in the full launch of Ethereum 2.0 some where between 2021-2025 [more details here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/cointelegraph.com/news/when-will-ethereum-2-0-fully-launch-roadmap-promises-speed-but-history-says-otherwise/amp). Proof of stake should reduce energy consumption by 99% [more details here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/ethereum-plans-to-cut-its-absurd-energy-consumption-by-99-percent.amp.html). Also since Ethereum is open source it is very likely that other coins will adopt of proof of stake model once it is fully released, not to mention all of ECR20 complaint coins that already run on the Ethereum network. Also for reference, around 74% of Bitcoin nodes relay of renewable energy as miners want to keep their operating costs as low as possible [source](https://www.ledger.com/energy-consumption-crypto-vs-fiat) this is likely similar for other crypto networks as the same people who mine bitcoin tend to act as nodes for other networks. Lastly from my understanding, although it gets a lot of media attention crypto mining is not nearly as harmful for the environment as other far more damaging industries such as the [livestock](https://www.google.com/amp/s/insideclimatenews.org/news/21102019/climate-change-meat-beef-dairy-methane-emissions-california/%3Famp) or [cruise ship](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL32450.html#_Toc280627472) industries for example.

Lastly I will say something that I feel gets left out of the crypto discourse a lot is that one of the main value propositions cryptocurrency and by extension NFTs is that it comes really close to completely solving the [double spending problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending?wprov=sfti1) which is super valuable on its own.

"Listen I'm not going to sit here and try and convince someone who is clearly anti cryptocurrencies. You are clearly anti and I am pro. It's high energy use, few minutes to process a transaction and current price volatility are the only cons I've found, and maybe the technical barrier to entry. This is why newer cryptocurrencies are being created daily, trying to capitalize on it's shortcomings, but bitcoin has the first to market advantage. The borderless transactions, and inability to be counterfeited or hacked, and inability to be censored are massive pros. No government can take my bitcoin from me unless I give them my password, and no government can print more. I personally both use it as a currency as well as an investment vehicle as I pointed out in a previous comment. It's incredibly similar to gold in that it can be both used as a commodity and a currency. Humans find gold to be attractive and it's scarce so it has value. Sure it is used in electronics but less and less as time goes on and humans had already deemed it valuable for thousands of years prior. And although bitcoin may actually seem scarce, there are 8 decimal points to every bitcoin at the moment, and the circulating supply could be increased if the network comes to a majority agreement to do so.

Aside, say a Nat Gas producer has to flare to meet legal requirements. Which, by the way, accounts for 1.3% of all Nat Gas made in the US.

[You may find this to be an interesting read](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/bitcoin-is-time/). Cryptocurrency truly reflects the will of the people (or at least, the will of the compute power). Imagine being able to transparently see the spending of a government entity; anyone could inspect the distributed ledger and see where their tax dollars went. Imagine if your taxes were integrated into the protocol; instead of having to fork over money to a faceless entity, fractions of coins automatically went to benefit people in need directly with no overhead of having to pay government middle-men. Don't want to give your money, or have a better idea for how it should be distributed? Vote with your computing power.

But using blockchain tech for currency is like using the internet for text messaging. We're seeing/will see many new innovations come out of blockchain. Ethereum adds the concept of ""Smart Contracts"", giving people the ability to write programs that miners execute, turning the mining pool into a giant distributed super computer. IPFS creates a distributed file system where people can host data. There exist websites that are currently hosted in no particular location. I think that's incredible.

For all of these technologies it's always easier and faster to just trust a centralized party to handle it for you: trust they're never wrong, that they can never be compromised or act selfishly. And that's what we've had to do for all of human history. But now for the first time we're developing the technology that gives us another option.

Gee, I wonder.

I didn't misconstrued anything. I wrote comes from renewables. You even quoted it.

Renewables suffer economically from variability. Which can be solved from demand side or load side. Hence the sin waves.

So your telling there's no acceleration or deceleration on adoption between a sector using, say, 10% renewables vs 39%? Buying less non renewables than market share forces adoption via commodity demand. What do you think disruption is? Who cares if BTC uses &gt;1% of total current renewable output if they increase thier competitiveness and reduce  thier risks to expand?

Greenwashing? You wanna change flare laws real quick or should I? Either way, it reduces GHGs that would otherwise exist. Temporarily benefitting nat gas produces, which, by the way, are an order of magnitude better for the environment than coal, doesn't make them last longer in the future. If suddenly there is a cheaper plant to produce with less risk than coal, coal dies even faster than it currently is.

Them paying gas companies for thier flare products doesn't suddenly make them cheaper to operate than solar. Solving the duck curve via artificial demand reduces variable producer competitiveness dipshit. Why do you think we still have them? It's not like battery costs and feasibility has been solved yet.

Let's look at gold production shall we. Bitcoin mining is cheaper $/$ to produce and uses 7 1/2 less energy. Wouldn't you want the precious metal industry to be replaced with a less wasteful model? Whatever you incent, happens. If it's cheaper to operate and produce excess green energy and run a bitcoin mine, why would investors put money into gold mines or non renewables.",1615587572.0,1

This created what's called a fork. Part of the community wanted to change the ledger to erase this theft and another part did not want to alter the blockchain. The original, with the theft, is the modern bitcoin, and the one without the theft (meaning they changed the blockchain) is bitcoin cash, a different currency.

For instance, a big issue with bitcoin is they can only really do 7 transactions per second. Compare that to a credit card company that can do 5000 transaction per second. This is know as the scalability problem, and some people want to change the blockchain code so more transactions can be processed per second. Compare that to ether, which makes a lot more blocks and can process more transactions. The problem is the more transactions you verify faster, tbe more ""orphan"" blocks you get. These are blocks a miner makes from picking transactions, but then never get added to the blockchain. This is an issue for ethereum because of their fast processing time, but not for bitcoin. Because bitcoin is slow, the new block info spreads to all the other nodes in the network faster than ethereum's ledger does.

I think your second sentence is an accurate understanding of the situation. I would add that the more computing power you have the more lottery tickets tickets you can take out, but yes, it's computers competing against one another.

"Bullshit? Dude, c'mon... this is basic finances. Seriously man, pick up a finance book for beginners at least. I'm begging you. 

You don't ""MAKE"" money until there's a taxable event, e.g. you sold the damn stock. His net worth valuation is based primarily via stock market growth. If you bought AMZN stock at $100 (to simply things), then it goes up to $150, it's just the rest of the market (buyers and sellers) ROUGHLY saying it's now worth $150. It's not a law that AMZN stock is now $150. You could try selling it on the stock market via your brokerage for $150, but that's just your offer, you might not find any buyers for $150. Anyway, you didn't sell because you think it will keep on rising, but it goes down to $80. You happened to have to sell at $80 because you needed some emergency funds. So you bought for $100, and you sold it for $80, you've experienced a net loss of $20. Now.. are we going to tax you for losing money? No, the loss will actually be deducted from your overall capital gains from potentially other stocks. So, you're not taxed on losses, makes sense right? The govt wants to incentivize people to invest in their economy after all and throw them a bone when you experience a bad break. Also, when it briefly went up to $150, is it right that you should be taxed for your ""net worth"" going up by $150 despite the fact that you only sold at a loss for $80? 

My dude, that's all that's going on. If you read an article saying Jeff Bezos's net worth increased by $80B or whatever during the pandemic, your first reaction is, ""fuck that guy,"" but it's just because his stocks that he's held when he... you know, started the company, increased in value, but he hasn't even sold them yet, so what would you be taxing for again? 

Reddit has a fairly optimistic bent on bitcoin and other crypto. Bitcoin's almost 10x up from just 1 year ago. If you're holding BTC, and it represents most of your wealth, then your net worth has 10x'ed too... but you haven't sold it yet, so according to most redditors here, we can tax you for your BTC's before you've actually realized a gain, right?",1615616852.0,1

"A “cope”? What are you, 13? lol  

You can’t build anything on top of Monero, and that’s the point of Monero. Building a PayPal on top of Monero that maintains RingCTs would not be possible. You would need both Monero accounts to be controlled and owned by the second layer solution, so it would just be PayPal. There would be no element of Monero to it. Layer 2 solutions are possible only on auditable blockchains. If you can’t readily look at previous transactions, you can’t establish an audit record, which means you can’t have any form of off-chain validation.   

Monero has a very small and limited purpose, and serves that purpose well enough, but it’s not a powerful or robust protocol by any stretch of the imagination. Also, Monero’s lack of auditability is precisely why so few KYC/AML-covered entities will trade in it, and it’s pretty unlikely that any institution will be trading in Monero a few years from now. That they ever did, or more importantly, that anyone ever used those services is baffling and ridiculous. Buying Monero on a regulated exchange and then sending it to an account you control is like sending your bank an email requesting $500 to spend on child pornography and drugs. We know a handful of three and four letter agencies already work with the big exchanges and that those exchanges share customer information with them freely. It just completely defeats the purpose and is something I’ll never understand.  

Does the dollar offer auditability? Yes. It absolutely does. It’s issued by a government. You’re probably not accustomed to the need for audit because you’re probably not dealing with enough money that you’d ever need to audit it. But the only way to get USD is through a bank (or through the Fed, directly, if you’re talking $10M+). Every single dollar that goes into circulation is tracked. Any time more than $10k in notes changes hands, it needs to be audited and included on an IRS Form 8300.  

While the handful of cash you’re using to support whatever form of slavery is your current thrill-of-the-week is a rounding error for people with money, if you’re making any real transactions or talking about any real amount of money, you need to be able to document where your money goes and then you need to be able to prove it in audit.  

Yes, Bitcoin was always intended to be a store of value. From the earliest days of the protocol, we have been comparing it to gold. It’s not “”””e-cash,”””” and never was. It circulates a hell of a lot faster than any fiat currency does, but fiat currencies all rely on networks of credit. Bitcoin transactions settle in 2-3 hours. Cash transactions in fiat settle in 3-4 days minimum. But cash is fungible and thus allows for the fuckery of QE and swaps and fractional reserving, because it’s a currency, not an asset/store of value. If you own Bitcoin, you own an immutable, unique asset, not unlike a piece of gold. That asset, or rather the TxIDs and TxO that make up its core, can be traced in audit all the way back to their generation in coinbases. This was and always has been the intent of the protocol. And it works more or less flawlessly.",1615650359.0,1

&gt; 2 Min Read.(Reuters) - Bitcoin, the world&amp;#039;s biggest cryptocurrency, on Saturday crossed a record high of $60,000.

&gt; A $1.5 billion bitcoin bet last month by Tesla Inc saw Elon Musk&amp;#039;s electric car company join business software firm MicroStrategy Inc and Twitter boss Jack Dorsey&amp;#039;s payments company Square Inc in swapping some traditional cash reserves for the digital coin.

&gt; It recently restarted a cryptocurrency trading desk and this month it started dealing bitcoin futures and non-deliverable forwards.

Yeah, a 10+ year long ponzi scheme that spawned the creation of hundreds of other block chain technologies that have coins associated with them and is ever increasing in value and implementation among the real world.

"The problem is if a bitcoin is worth 1 million it will cost approx 1 million dollars to mine one. 

That's an insane loss of energy.   Unless we can tie mining to say carbon capture or some other good for the earth value bitcoin will end up being a terrible idea.  Concept is good but block chain only needs a reasonably high rate of miners.   There needs to be an eco friendly hash algorithm.",1615662778.0,1
"&gt;At this point Elon Musk's 1.5b purchase of bitcoin has offset nearly 40% of the carbon reduction gains his electric cars have made

How do you figure that?  It's pretty hard to put a carbon figure on bitcoin transactions, and even harder to put a figure on held coins.  There is no linear relationship between quantity transacted and power consumed.  The way that Tesla's holdings probably most directly influence network electricity consumption is by increasing the price, which increases the mining incentive.

The other major confound is how the electricity used by the network is generated.  I don't think it makes sense to use an international average.  Mining is most profitable in places where electricity is cheap, which is usually places where the grid is powered by hydro. That profitablity difference is made bigger by higher prices/ more competitive mining.

The advent of PoW crypto mainly emphasizes the need to get to 100% renewable sources for our grid.  Increasing electrical consumption is a common feature of a lot of tech innovation, including the traditional financial networks and EVs.",1615662801.0,1

Also do you think Tesla, EVs, your phones, laptop are charged from clean energy?  The decentralized system of bitcoin is consuming power, guess what else consumes power, labor, and lots of land?  Banks! People don't even realize how much power one building uses, and let alone over millions of bank branches. 

Now the banks and financial systems that not only provided wealthy people to be wealthy while keeping the poorer poor they now are paying news networks, newspapers in millions to talk about how bad bitcoin is in consuming power lol.  Sure but the issue isn't bitcoin is consuming power, it should be what is the source of this power.",1615667855.0,-1
"One of the major reasons people like Crypto is to avoid shit like the Fed. So I don't think the Fed issuing their own crypto is going to be wildly accepted, as it's sort of the antithesis of some of the reasoning behind crypto to begin with.

As we see big tech and government control getting bigger, the backlash against that will also grow. The tech behind crypto can help distance everyone from that through decentrialization of pretty much any system that is currently controlled by an elite few. 

So who's at the top of this ponzi scheme anyway? The creator of bitcoin created it, then dipped out and is still unknown to this day. Why would someone who creates a ponzi scheme make it, and then bail out and not profit from it?",1615667932.0,1
"I actually wrote about this a little in my third year dissertation when I discovered a UK escort agency accepting bitcoin for payment.

"You'd be a lot less fond of the thought of people collectively handling national budgets once you realize that the average person is often selfish and totally unqualified to enact state policy at that level. Imagine if everyone had total control over how the government spent their tax dollars. How many people would volunteer their contributions to be spent on public services and infrastructure projects on the other side of the country? And if the actions of the ""fuck you, got mine"" crowd became public, how many others would retaliate against them by withholding funding for their part of the country? The end result of all that transparency and voting with your wallet would be an overall drop of funding for necessary public services. You have to give elected officials some level of power to actually decide on a budget and run a city, state, or nation, because a direct democracy in a country of tens to hundreds of millions of people all having the last say on how they want their tax dollars to be spent simply isn't workable. Either a majority starts deferring to the most popular experts of the day anyway, in which case we're back to where we started, or the budget is going to be a constant shitshow of competing interests that's perpetually underfunded and paralyzed by inaction.  

Also keep in mind a lot of places around the world, especially democratic countries, already provide public access to government spending records. When was the last time you cracked open an annual budget report for your municipality to see how your city was spending your tax dollars? Now imagine a blockchain ledger based system where everyone can see where every last cent of their tax dollars was spent, divided among thousands of taxpayer funded expenditures every year. Who's going to pay for that massive amount of IT infrastructure and bureaucratic overhead? And is it remotely worthwhile given how little the average taxpayer makes use of centralized government budget reports *today*?  

""Smart"" contracts are also a terrible idea, because they're designed as ""code is law"" programs that *can't be patched* once they hit the blockchain. That's their entire appeal. They're irreversible, just like bitcoin transactions. But just as being your own bank with bitcoins means being your own banking security, which is damn hard and a perfect invitation for hackers and fraudsters to steal your money, trusting the code a counterparty wrote will do exactly what both you and they intend and *nothing more* once it's running on the mainnet is also a [recipe for disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_\(organization\)). And if things blow up, as they inevitably do, you're either trusting a centralized authority to fork the entire goddamn blockchain just to save your butt, or you're shit out of luck. This is a *terrible* way to write and enforcement business contracts, compared to the legal systems that we have already.  

Blockchain as a technology is a solution in search of a problem. In just about every case where it can be used, existing solutions handle the problem better for the vast majority of users and situations. The small number of cases where that doesn't apply is either due to criminality, or will facilitate criminality due to the fundamental nature of immutable blockchains.  

If you trust in blockchains, you're trusting the developers don't hold outsized power to act as a central authority, that miners will remain disinterested and distributed third parties that will keep the system running, that all layers of the system from the foundations up to the individual programs you're running off it are error free and immune to attack, and that no third party can crash the system with their bullshit token printing or network transaction delaying shenanigans. And all the while, all these people you have to trust are likely to be even less accountable to you and more self serving than the politicians you voted upon. If you hate government overreach already, why would you want completely unaccountable non-government entities to have such a frightening amount of power over your life?",1615676957.0,-1

"This is a complete misunderstanding of both the energy consumption and value of Bitcoin.

These claims about Bitcoins energy consumption never offer a valid point of comparison.   Bitcoin’s consumption of energy is on par with the world’s video game habit, to say nothing about the energy consumption that goes into actually making those games.  

How about the energy consumption of the financial industry as a whole? Obviously, a decentralized system won’t be as efficient as a Visa transaction.  But Bitcoin is not just a transaction mechanism.  It can be, simultaneously, Visa, a bank to store your money, a “central bank” for the whole world.  How much energy goes to those systems worldwide?

Finally, let’s talk about the value of Bitcoin.  The alternative ways to store value and measure the price of goods are all fiat currencies, which are currently being devalued by governments every single year.   

I recommend that everyone unaware read about US monetary policy (which is really world monetary policy).  Every year that they decide your dollar should be worth less than the year before is theft from working people.  

Why has the stock market been on a tear the last few decades? Why has real estate been one of the best investments historically?  Because people don’t have any other place to put their money without it losing value.  The price of these assets isn’t just increasing because they’re “good investments”.  Their price is increasing because the dollar is constantly decreasing value relative to them.  

If you have money to invest, this is great for you.  If you work for a living, with wages mostly stagnant for the last couple of decades, you are getting screwed.  

So “fuck you, I’ve got mine”? Try looking at the current financial and monetary system of the US before you rail against Bitcoin.",1615730453.0,1

"If you want to send money across countries money orders already exist. Which also don't have limitations on who can receive them.

And money orders happen in currencies that are accepted by local stores which crypto isn't.

Which brings us back to the beginning.

Crypto isn't a faster transaction than already existing methods.

It is significantly more expensive than the current methods. Both in a monetary and environmental sense.

And they are worse at reliability as they need power to work which physical money doesn't. (And due to their massive price fluctuations making physical cash of cryptocurrencies doesn't really work as you are either way above the current worth of materials or way below them and also can't really match security measures to the price)


So they straight up aren't better currencies than what already exists.

"&gt; *Except the system operator is the exact person you're complaining about here, the Government.*

Ideally the system shouldn't be run by the government, it should be run by an impartial entity, and everything should be open source.

&gt; *All you're doing is creating the perfect way for any Government to anonymous rig any election results*

If the system operator doesn't store private keys, it can't vote for the people. Think of something like Bitcoin. The system sends 1 BTC to each of the voters. And then there are addresses for the candidates, where people send their coin-votes, or don't send them at all if they don't like any candidates.

&gt; *Which is entirely useless for verifying if illegitimate votes have been added.*

It's not entirely useless. It eliminates one form of corruption. Your argument is silly, and amounts to ""if you can't solve every single problem, there's no point in solving even one problem"".

"&gt; Think of something like Bitcoin. The system sends 1 BTC to each of the voters. And then there are addresses for the candidates, where people send their coin-votes, or don't send them at all if they don't like any candidates.

Except Bitcoin relies on the hashing power of any one person not rising above 51% of the total hashing power, otherwise someone can double spend or reverse bitcoin transactions. Taking away the confirmination process makes this voting system essentially a glorified hash check that serves no purpose except for you to know how your specific vote itself was recorded. That doesn't help anyone uncover any types of fraud or illegal activities

&gt;It's not entirely useless. It eliminates one form of corruption. Your argument is silly, and amounts to ""if you can't solve every single problem, there's no point in solving even one problem"".


Except your solution causes several more problems that are far worse than singular votes being miscounted which evens itself out across the entire population. Your system would allow blackmail to be easily carried out (since I could force you to show me how you voted), would allow the Government to alter votes far easier, would allow foreign adversaries to alter results with the US Government having no idea, etc.


If I wanted to change the US election result with a paper system i'd have to either convince thousands of people to lie on my behalf (extremely low chance of success) or somehow manage to evenly stuff paper ballots into all areas across the country to avoid suspicion (also a low chance of success).

Meanwhile a hacker with this system would just need to gain access to the private keys and would be able to cast doubt, invalidate or otherwise corrupt any votes that they chose to.

&gt;and physical addresses of every voter in advance (voter registrations) in advance.


Again, how does this work? Either you've gotta sign all the public keys with the same private key (still proving nothing except for how your own specific vote was cast) or sign them with the same key and have the ability to check how anyone else voted in the election.


It'd also give the #1 blackmail since now I could come around to your house, tell you to vote a certain way or **else** and then check afterwards if you actually listened to me.


&gt;This way you can't have a single added vote without it being obvious.

Except you could.


If you checked that your specific vote has been counted, how does that prove that any of the other links in the chain haven't been compromised?

"Computer hackers attacked Broward County schools, demanding as much as $40 million in ransom to prevent personal information about students and teachers from being published, according to a transcript the hackers released online.

Hackers with the international malware group Conti posted a transcript March 26 of what they say is a two-week negotiation with a representative from Broward schools. The hackers started with an offer of $40 million and later reduced the demand to $15 million and then $10 million.

ADVERTISEMENT
The unidentified district representative counter-offered with $500,000, which appeared to end negotiations, the transcript shows.

“We have no intention of paying a ransom,” the school district said Wednesday in a statement from the office of Chief Communications Officer Kathy Koch. The district did not confirm or deny the authenticity of the transcript.

The statement said the district is working with cyber-security experts to investigate what happened and restore systems, and that effort is going well.

“At this point in the investigation, we are not aware of any student or employee personal data that has been compromised as a result of this incident,” the statement from Koch’s office said. “If the investigation uncovers any compromised personal data, the district will provide appropriate notification to those affected.”

Although any postings from criminals should be viewed with skepticism, school cyber-security expert Doug Levin and others say there’s a good chance the chat is authentic.

“It doesn’t paint the Conti group in a great light, demanding money from a school district,” Levin said. “There’s certainly no honor among thieves targeting a school district.”

Levin said that when a breach like this happens, people should assume that personal data is at risk.

RELATED: Who are the Conti computer hackers? »
“If I were a parent, student or employee in the district and I’d been assured there’s nothing for me to worry about, there’s evidence to suggest the contrary,” said Levin, national director of K12 Security Information Exchange, a nonprofit group based in Virginia that assists school districts facing cybersecurity threats.

He said children’s data is often valuable to thieves because they can establish credit using their names without anyone noticing.

The hackers told the district they do have personal data, according to a transcript that began March 12, five days after hackers attacked the district’s computers and caused a temporary shutdown of most systems. The hacker responded after a representative from the district asked how to retrieve the data.

“The bad news is that we hacked your network and encrypted your servers, as well as downloaded more than 1 terabyte of your personal data, including financial, contracts, databases and other documents containing [social security numbers], addresses, [date of birth] and other information about students and teachers,” the hacker wrote.

The hacker then said the information could be retrieved for $40 million, a price that flabbergasted the district representative.

“I am ... speechless. Surely this is a mistake? Are there extra zero’s in that number by mistake?” the person asked.

The hacker responded that a review of school records showed revenues of more than $4 billion “so it is a possible amount for you.”

ADVERTISEMENT
“I am so confused. This is a PUBLIC school district. public, meaning it is free for students to attend,” the district representative wrote. “You cannot possibly think we have anything close to this!”

“What is your position?” the hacker asked.

“My position is shock and horror that anyone thinks a taxpayer-funded school district could afford this kind of money!”

RELATED: ‘Zoom bombers’ invade virtual classrooms with racist, vulgar comments »
The price would be dropped to $15 million if the district agreed to pay within 24 hours in bitcoin, the hacker said. The district representative argued that it was the weekend and banks were closed.

“We don’t have bitcoins! This is a school district. No one here uses a cryptocurrency,” the representative said. “This is a weekend and we could not even pay you $10 today let alone millions when our bank is closed.”

The conversation continued for two weeks, with the district representative pleading to lower the price. On March 26, the hackers lowered their price to $10 million, which the district official said was still unreasonable.

“You attacked a school district that only has money sent to us by the government. We make no profits or anything like that. We have approval to offer $500,000, but the price ranges you started with are too far off for a taxpayer funded school,” the representative said.

The conversation ended at that point.

RELATED: Hackers may have stolen patient information from University of Miami Health System »
Koch’s office did not respond to questions about why the $500,000 figure was chosen. Under district policy, $500,000 is the maximum the district can pay without School Board approval in a public meeting.

“I’m sure that figure was chosen intentionally,” said Levin, the security consultant. “If the chat log is accurate, they made the calculation they were willing to pay that money to have it go away.”

The district made no public comments about the ransomware incident until Wednesday, after the South Florida Sun Sentinel asked questions about the transcript.

Aston Henry, director of risk management, sent a note to employees Wednesday afternoon saying a March 7 disruption “was caused by unauthorized activity on our computer network. Our security team enacted our incident response plan and promptly took steps to contain this incident and secure the network. We contacted law enforcement and immediately began an investigation.”

“Your confidence and trust are important to us and we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause,” Henry wrote. “We have already implemented additional security measures to enhance the security of our network, including deploying endpoint threat detection and response tools.”

As of Wednesday evening, no notice had gone out to parents about the threat.

And for the peseta the transition also wipes out two digits from everyone's bank account. 3 digits for the lira.

And again.

Switching currencies doesn't stop hyperinflation. However having control of your currency makes it a lot easier to stop hyperinflation or economic turmoil in general.

Switching currencies just gets prices back to sensible levels instead of everything being in the billions and up. Which is the definition of wiping out zeros. Fucks sake you could even do it in the same currency by issuing a new series of coins and notes and having an unequal exchange between the old and new series.

Furthermore prices in USD are in the sensible range. A loaf of bread isn't in the millions or higher. So changing to bitcoin doesn't make prices sensible again. It makes them less sensible as you are now dealing with a whole bunch of zeros before the important part.

Also bitcoin currently has inflation and the second it stops having inflation it becomes deflationary. Which is also bad. Because suddenly your money buys more tomorrow than it does today so no one buys anything that isn't absolutely necessary. Leading to an economic crash. So some inflation is good as it keeps the people spending and also stops money from accumulating at the top too fast.

"You've lost track of the issue you were talking about, and are now responding absolute nonsense. Let me remind you. You said a problem with bitcoin is that if hyper-inflation hits, government cannot wipe out a bunch of them to fight hyper-inflation.

Now, on to the recap:

You started talking about forced exchange of hyper-inflated money to the new monetary standard to fight inflation. Something you have no source stating happens. And at the same time, you introduced the solution to the problem. Banks can just stop accepting bitcoin if hyper-inflation hits. Maybe change Bitcoin for [another currency] in people's bank accounts to fight inflation. They wipe out a bunch of zeroes and inflation has been successfully fought. You refuse to then acknowledge that under that logic, buying bitcoin reduces inflation, seeing as how you wipe out 4 zeroes by buying bitcoin. And so I'm stuck calling you a liar for your lies while you keep introducing new talking points that I will not acknowledge, because you refuse to acknowledge your own damn lies.

Fun fact. [A loaf of bread in 1960 was worth $0.23, and now it's worth about 10 times that.](https://tasks.illustrativemathematics.org/content-standards/tasks/1330) Thus, if we start pricing everything in a crypto that's worth $10, we can fight inflation back to the reasonable pricing levels of 1960.

It isn't a one person blame here. Participants are just as important because they are the ones who gave him the power (responsibility). Maybe you guys should wake up and realize what you are personally giving out online (your market info which translates to your life style) or where you spend your money and what actually having the amount of goods and services we currently have, globally is doing to local communities.  

The dude wants to create a word where you can literally talk into your phone and get whatever you need. People exactly like you (not personal, just the set of data I have recieved from you that could be correlated to multiple people of similar views,ie: a generation) don't see the important work he does for of all us. That translation is then converted into our current market tool. Money. 

So now you are actively participating in a market that actively makes you say stupid shit online creating data sets that continues the perpetuation of future growth. Pick whatever label you want to throw growth under, because every data set I am talking about has some relation to every other dataset somehow. 

Once you have freed yourself from the illusionary concepts the market provides the ruling class, not the other way around, you can then create your own market position based off your position and depending on how far back you want to cherish community and your own goals for the future will determine how far you, everyone around you, will make it. The height of our achievement once we all realize how strong our participation points are in our daily lives now to the correlation of  marketing positions we see daily.

To show you the practice of this philosophy, what bitcoin really means as a social construct. I have and will continue to participate. Not just for myself but for you, everyone who down voted me, everyone who hates facebook and everyone who loves facebook. Facebook is an image set to you to hide the power of the community behind it.

I have just participated in data manipulation to perpetuate the future market I want to create without ignoring the community that got me here. How? By creating this data set. By talking and validating another dataset (whoever reads this). This market is not my creation. There are other's like me, who understand the importance of community in our time and the ruling class is paying us to spread this message. 

I know it is a lot to take it. It has been a hard journey for myself in understanding what we are doing here and now in the 21st century. Now I must go manipulate more sets to spread the message that was brought to me. Technology is here. Sorry I will not be able to continue this conversation but I have to go and create another set of data, have it validated with current tools, to help someone else get a job. 

I thought I was doing this for free but now I understand I am getting paid for my service. The country I am from has started one of these new service tools for the internet and their good graces on the global stage is about to become a short position.

In 2015, when Oprah Winfrey bought 10% of Weight Watchers stock, the stock's value shot up.

She also joined the board which signaled to investors that she was going to protect her investment and help it grow by making improvements to the company.

Telsa is a company that sells new technology (electric cars, solar energy). Bitcoin is a new currency technology. Tesla's endorsement of bitcoin made people take notice, just like Oprah did for Weight Watchers.

Bitcoin doesn't have a board of directors, and I don't really know how Tesla could influence the health of bitcoin. Telsa has started accepting bitcoin for payment, which is a bit when a government guarantees its currency.

"Nothing you said really contradicts what I said in my last post so let me clarify. We agree that miners will mine as long as it remains profitable. I believe that the initial investment for the core mining force has already been made. Because of this the main costs cutting into profits is electricity, as long as bitcoin remains at a high and stable enough value the amount of transactions made using bitcoins will only increase therefore increasing the chances for miners globally to claim the transaction fees maintaining profitability.

Because of this I believe that the electricity cost will not decline in any meaningful way once verifying transactions has become the primary function of mining.

We know that Bitcoin is designed so that it will eventually 'live' off of transaction fees. The idea being that even a teeny tiny fee per transaction will be enough to feed the economy, since there will be zillions of transactions.

The question then is : Does the equilibrium point for fee-based profitability have a LOWER energy cost than the equilibrium point for a BTC-plus-fees model?

The answer, of course, is YES!

See, BTC miners currently generate profits by relying PRIMARILY on new BTC generation and to a MUCH smaller extent, fees.

\-----------

Think about it... Right now, mining one block of BTC requires X kWh. In return for this, miners get 2 things. Fees, and (some) new Bitcoin.

**CURRENTLY** :   \[ \]  = One block. 2 rewards. \[ new BTC + fees \]

Once the Bitcoin is removed, miners ONLY receive the fees.

**FUTURE** :   \[ \]  = One block. 1 reward.  \[ fees \]

Less is less. You would need a SHITLOAD more transactions than we have now, or MUCH higher fees to maintain the current profitability of mining. This is unlikely, since :

A. If fees get too high, people will stop using it.

B. There is a capacity limitation to the number of transactions per block AND mining a block requires a set amount of time, based on hashrate, and total transactions.

&amp;#x200B;

Transaction capacity was exceeded once in 2017, Segwit was the fix then, that made transactions 'smaller' and thus reduced fees by increasing capacity. THis article touches on the problem of the past. [https://www.coindesk.com/state-of-blockchains-bitcoin-btc-fees](https://www.coindesk.com/state-of-blockchains-bitcoin-btc-fees)

The following article touches on the problem of the future. Eventually, there is a hard limit on the total possible transactions per block. At the point you reach this limit, the only way to increase the value of mining a block is to increase the fees... But... Then you run into problem A.

[https://towardsdatascience.com/the-blockchain-scalability-problem-the-race-for-visa-like-transaction-speed-5cce48f9d44](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-blockchain-scalability-problem-the-race-for-visa-like-transaction-speed-5cce48f9d44)

**Long story short :** BTC has a theoretical max of 7 transactions per second (TPS), and one block produces 6.25 BTC (currently).

One block takes about 10 min (600 seconds) \[this can change based on hashrate, more miners = faster, but more miners require more value... more on this later\]

So, at $50k for BTC, 1 block is worth $312k... So, 7 tps over 600 seconds = 4200 transactions.

Alright, so to make $312,000 in fees per block, at 4200 transactions per block, you would need an average fee of...

312,000/4200 = 74

**$74 fucking dollars.**

That's insane. NO ONE will pay $74 to make transactions. It's stupid. **It's problem A.**Even now the transaction fee is around $30, which is only fixed by people using giant wallets to hold their money and having those giant wallets make batch transactions. (Basically centralizing control to a BTC bank, defeating the purpose of crypto)...

**Here is the final nail in the coffin** : BTC price is present based on the profitability of mining, and the demand for coins (speculation). Once new BTC are all mined, and fees are the only profit left, the **$/BTC** will be based on the **$/block**, which is FIXED and based on fees.

In other words: BTC will TANK.

Right now, fees are around $30 and the TPS is only 4.5 (or 2700 transactions per block). So $30/transaction \* 2700/transactions per block = $81,000 in fees per block.Remember, this is at 6.25 BTC per block... if we want to compare value-value, we divide this by 6.25...  $81,000/6.25= $12,960.

So... 1 BTC @ $50k is made up for $12,960 in fees and $37,040 in speculation.

Ultimately, miners will drop off as it wont be profitable, the fees will remain low, and the difficulty will drop. Consequently, the hashrate will drop, thus lowering the TPS or time to mine a block... this decreases profitability further, thus more miners leave... Less TPS, less profit, less miners, less tps, etc etc

Here even BTC implies as much :

[https://btc.com/stats/fee](https://btc.com/stats/fee)

In 2017, the HIGHEST FEES EVER only made up 30% of the total block reward. Meaning 70% of the reward was new BTC.

30% is not equal to 100%. Once there is no new BTC, the value of a block will drop.

**No matter how you look at it, the energy consumption to maintain BTC will get lower.**

Either miners leave and it reaches a balance at a lower hashrate with less people, or it tanks and loses all value entirely.",1618613831.0,-1

But bitcoin is using much less total energy and resources than the global banking system and all its past and continued building up of its infrastructure.

I would say bitcoin in its 12 years of existence poses no more a threat than the status quo some wish to maintain while you can’t see the lasting effects just the banks/financial institutions have on many parts of the world in a not so positive way.
Shouldn’t these things be completely compared and projections of future likelihood’s be compared properly rather than people throwing out strange and immediately verifiable non truths?

"If the government is able to crack the private key of a bitcoin wallet they have essentially defeated cryptographic security as we know it and the internet is no longer safe.

Here is a good representation of why they won't be cracking wallets

&gt;Modern cryptographic systems are essentially unbreakable, particularly if an adversary is restricted to intercepts. We have argued for, designed, and built systems with 128 bits of security precisely because they are essentially unbreakable. It is very easy to underestimate the power of exponentials. 2^128 is a very big number. Burt Kaliski first came up with this characterization, and if he had a nickel for every time I tell it, he could buy a latte or three.

&gt;Imagine a computer that is the size of a grain of sand that can test keys against some encrypted data. Also imagine that it can test a key in the amount of time it takes light to cross it. Then consider a cluster of these computers, so many that if you covered the earth with them, they would cover the whole planet to the height of 1 meter. The cluster of computers would crack a 128-bit key on average in 1,000 years.

&gt;If you want to brute-force a key, it literally takes a planet-ful of computers. And of course, there are always 256-bit keys, if you worry about the possibility that government has a spare planet that they want to devote to key-cracking.

There’s nowhere remotely near most major US cities that people can afford to pick up and move to. Especially when every dollar they have is sunk in a home, in the dying town they grew up in, with no hopes of getting their money back.

Bitcoin mining secures the blockchain, making it “immutable”. This means the ledger can be freely distributed without anyone being able to change it. It is very hard to mine each block, harder again to mine a series of blocks (of transactions).

Have you noticed how unnecessary it is to store things you don't want to? it doesn't matters how small storage gets, you still store massive amounts of data for a blockchain. The bitcoin blochchain is some 350+GB in size, and if I don't want to offload trust to someone else, I need to store the entire 350 GB.

We never hear about how bad gold mining is, or how horrible cobalt mining is or even how much energy the banking world uses, but the energy usage of bitcoin is super important apparently, but not important enough to mention the number of cryptos using or moving to pos. that seems like an important line that’s always missing and why I think the articles are just an attack on crypto in general.",1619214558.0,1
"... As such, bitcoin mining uses an exorbitant amount of power: somewhere between an estimated 30 terrawatt hours alone in 2017 alone. 

That's as much electricity as it takes to power the entire nation of Ireland in one year. Indeed, this is a lot, but not exorbitant. 


Banking consumes an estimated 100 terrawatts of power annually. If bitcoin technology were to mature by more than 100 times its current market size, it would still equal only 2 percent of all energy consumption.

"&gt;A lot of mining is already centralized and is getting worse. A region in China last week had a powercut and I think 50% of btc mining stopped.

The network hashrate hasn't fallen by 50% recently, but yes, centralization in mining is a concern.  As long as there is still wide full node distribution then it shouldn't be a problem. 


&gt;Then there is the concept of security, so far btc has been subject to wash trading, it has value generated from nothing as new coins get spawned off from the old coins.

Not from nothing - from PoW hashing that benefits the network.

&gt;There is plenty of deregulation and shadyness in regards to the exchanges themselves. There is the fact that there is little security for the actual users who can casually lose btc with 0 recourse. Wallets can still be stolen, exchanges still hacked, list goes on.

Sure, anything can be stolen or involved in scams, and things that can be transferred digitally and immutably are particularly attractive targets.  I would say that most non tech people probably shouldn't use bitcoin today.  That might change someday as more user friendly end user services come about.  PayPal / square / venmo etc are clearly aspiring to that.


&gt;This is in contrast to something like VISA where if money is stolen, there are conventional channels to recover.

That's a different product for a different use case, not something that's directly comparable.  No reason Visa couldn't process transactions denominated and settled in bitcoin for people who want credit card functionality.


&gt; BTC doesn't scale past 350k transactions per day and this won't ever change unless btc chooses to change block sizes. 

Sure it can, just not on chain.  There is no reason every transaction should be on chain.  Layer 2 techs like lightning are one way of addressing that.  Proprietary networks like Visa could be another.  Most day to day transactions don't need to be immutably recorded for all posterity.

&gt;All of this means that compared with conventional notions of security, stability and scalability, btc fails spectacularly in comparison to something like VISA which can handle hundreds of thousands of transactions per second.

That's not what bitcoin is trying to accomplish.  Proprietary systems for processing transactions are plentiful and they work really well.  Bitcoin is an open source, censorship-resistant system for storing and transacting value independent of any governing or regulatory body.  Visa is a system for processing transactions - it's functioning is dependent on everything from central banks (to manage the currency you're transacting) to consumer banks.",1619215077.0,1
"""Gamestop As Major Stakeholder In Bitcoin SV....One Billion Gamers""

📷

Sat, Apr 17, 3:33 PM (1 day ago)**📷\*\*\*\*📷**to investorrelations📷  
CEO of Gamestop,  
I really like Gamestop to pursue an exciting investment opportunity that will raise its brand and market value with crypto currency with esports gaming and live betting.   
There is an esports game being developed on BSV called ""Crypto Fights"" with live betting features. It promises to be the FIRST on blockchain...totally transparent. It is a prelude to ""Ready Player One"". Many are dubbing BSV as ""Ready Player One"" currency as all credits and staking will be in BSV currency. This phenomenon will infect 1 billion gamers worldwide. Very big money is about to FOMO after the investment forum in Dubai 28-30 and 1-2 April with sovereign funds and billionaires trusts ready to invest.  
I propose Gamestop buy at least 5 million BSV coins at under $500 to soak up the supply to corner the market so that the price will go parabolic towards $15 000 a coin. BSV (Bitcoin SV) has been granted 1000 patents on its blockchain by the US patents office since 2020 Feb. It is endorsed by Saxion University in Netherlands which offers online courses on BSV (Bitcoin SV) as the future blockchain to rule the world.  
As the industry leader in blockchain technology for real money gaming, Bitboss is bringing iGaming to Bitcoin SV.

Sincerely

"&gt;I am referring to the bitcoin cash, and all the other derivative forks. Those new alt coins all have 'value' spawned from nowhere.

That's not really an accurate description.  Either way, so what?  Who cares?


&gt;Not to mention that there is 0 value for visa to even bother using btc for transactions.

Not for transactions - they already have their own network for that - for an underlying currency that transactions are denominated and settled in.  


&gt;This doesn't scale for the simple reason that each device needs to compute the entire graph/channels needed for a transaction. 

Okay, if lightning proves to computationally expensive then they'll need to use something else.


&gt;There isn't a need for bitcoin transactions.

If you don't need it then don't use it.  Feel free to tell people how much you hate it in reddit comments.

&gt;It's been a while since i read the whitepaper but I distinctly remember it being described it as use for a form of currency.

It is a currency and it could be used to buy coffee.  There is no reason every transaction needs to go on chain.  Off chain transactions don't make it not a currency.  You're getting fixated on a weird semantic point here.


&gt;Ya it's great for illegal purposes, for scamming venture capitalists and acting as one giant pyramid/ponzi scheme.

All currencies are good for those things.  


&gt;As a storage of value, it's utter shite. At the moment it can drop to value to nothing and there are plenty of speculations that it can.

There's literally a two week period in all of history that you could have bought bitcoin and have it be worth less today than you paid for it.  The overall trend is one that makes it good for storing value.


&gt;At the end of the day, you are storing a text file. A text file that you can easily lose, is hard to insure and could be entirely worthless at a drop of a hat. Not exactly a stelar store of value 

I don't store a text file related to a bitcoin wallet.  I haven't done that since like 2014.

&gt; compared with something like gold that has existed for 2000 years.

Then go buy yourself some gold if that's what you're into (though you should know it's certainly much older than 2000 years old).  I think you'd probably do better leaving your money as cash in most currencies, but you do you.


&gt;The only thing it's useful is for illegal purposes and to serve as a speculative stock akin to Tesla. 

Yeah, I'd agree that one of it's most important use cases is ""illegal purposes"". You realize that ""illegal"" is relative and always changing all over the world?  Plenty of governments say that uncensored internet is only something that criminals would want - do you agree with that?

"&gt;Ethereum Proof of Stake + Virtual Machine will phase out bitcoin the way the motor car phased out horse drawn carriages.

I'm sorry but this is a ridiculous statement. Ethereum is a Dapp platform. Bitcoin is focused on being a store of value/money.

Ethereum is centralized around the Ethereum Foundation who own all the infrastructure built around Ethereum ( Infura, Metamask, ConsenSys). They control the direction of Ethereum and its monetary policy.

Also Ethereum moving to Proof of Stake is exactly like the existing fiat system. Those who control the wealth, controls the rules.  This is exactly what Bitcoin is trying to get away from. Ethereum Also had a 72% premine of the entire supply. All this might be fine for a Dapp platform but not for money.

You can't just have a 5 year project focused on being a Dapp platform, slap on some deflationary issuance change and call it a day and think its money/SoV...

Bitcoin is the only project that had a truly fair launch. No premine. Two month notice before launch and open to the public. People could support the network and be rewarded with Bitcoin. This slow distribution over several years can never be replicated.

Bitcoin has no leaders, no foundation and the only crypto that has true decentralized governance. Nobody has control over Bitcoin. Also Bitcoins monetary policy is set in stone since it was created. Only 21,000,000 coins ever to be created with issuance to cut by 50% around every 4 years. Those rules have been set and cannot be changed. When you buy Bitcoin, you know your share/value of the network can NEVER be diluted.

Ethereum has no cap on supply and has centrally changed its inflation rate over 10 times already. Again this may be OK for Dapps but not for decentralized money.  Bitcoin has it's place and will never be phased out by Ethereum. Thinking so is extremely naive.",1619220951.0,1

More than a few feet, but yes, it's cool underground.

Just go straight to the cold source for cooling, and skip the bitcoin.

&gt; actually drying your clothes inside in a dryer is worse than mining bitcoin

That's not a reason to mine bitcoin, that's a reason to line-dry your clothes.

&gt; proof of work is more than just securing a network

We agree there-- proof-of-work is also a terrible, terrible waste of energy at a time when we do not have enough renewable energy for our critical needs.

"&gt; im curious but have you ever spent this much time argueing for people to stop using electric clothes dryers?

YES.  Stop wasting power.  Ride your bike to work.  Line-dry your clothes.  Eat less meat.  Go solar.  Buy less shit.  And stop wasting an epic shitload of energy on a problem we've already solved much more efficiently.

Mining runs 24/7, and you'd have to be doing a LOT of laundry for your dryer to use more energy than even a single GPU mining rig.  A dryer may use more power than a small mining rig... but dryers do not run 24/7.  

&gt; maybe you dont want world unity

World unity would be great, but a collapsing environment will NOT promote world unity-- it will cause massive upheaval, death, and war.  Bitcoin is a disaster.  I used to wonder how the villains in cartoons could pollute for money when I was a kid... but it turns out that it's not just giant evil corporations.

"MacKenzie Scott Gave Away Billions. The Scam Artists Followed.

She has no large foundation, headquarters or public website. That makes it easier to dispense money on her own terms — and for others to prey on the vulnerable in her name.

Credit...Chris Koehler

By Nicholas Kulish

April 24, 2021

Danielle Churchill needed help. She was raising five children in Wollongong, on the Australian coast south of Sydney, and had to cover thousands of dollars in special therapy fees for her 10-year-old son, Lachlan, who has autism. She tried crowdfunding on the site GoFundMe, but raised just a tiny fraction of what she had hoped for.

Late last year, she received the message that seemed to solve her financial problems. It was purportedly an email from the billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, a novelist best known as the ex-wife of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, saying that she was giving away half her fortune and that Ms. Churchill had qualified for a grant.

Ms. Churchill searched Google for Ms. Scott’s name and the word “scam.” Instead of warnings, she found numerous news articles describing how Ms. Scott’s representatives had emailed hundreds of nonprofit groups out of the blue with offers of monetary support.

“People were thinking they were scams, but then they came true,” Ms. Churchill, 34, recalled thinking.

Over the course of 2020, Ms. Scott announced gifts totaling nearly $6 billion. Her unconventional model of giving was widely praised for its speed and directness. But some of the seeming advantages — no large, established foundation, headquarters, public website or indeed any way to reach her or her representatives — are exactly what made her ripe for impersonation by scammers, as Ms. Churchill would soon find out.

To receive the money, Ms. Churchill had to fill out a “membership form” sent by an organization calling itself the MacKenzie Scott Foundation and set up an online account with Investors Bank and Trust Company. She could see that the foundation had transferred $250,000 into the account in her name, but because she was in Australia, she was told that she had to apply for a tax number and pay some associated fees before she could get access to the money and begin spending it on speech and occupational therapy for Lachlan.

“I was doing my research, looking up everything they were telling me,” Ms. Churchill said. She added that her grandmother had looked things over and thought it was legitimate. “Everything you ask, they send you proof. The online bank says everything is secure.”

What Ms. Churchill did not know was that there is no MacKenzie Scott Foundation. The Investors Bank and Trust Company, once based in Boston, had been folded into State Street Corporation more than a decade ago. And Ms. Churchill was not dealing with Ms. Scott and her team but a sophisticated group of scammers adept at preying on vulnerable people.

In Ms. Churchill’s case, the scam involved not just the fake bank portal but counterfeit Facebook pages, WhatsApp messages and the use of a Bitcoin cryptocurrency app to whisk the money away, roughly $7,900 American dollars in all, so she could not reclaim it with the help of a bank or credit-card company.

An email-security company in Israel, Ironscales, said messages purporting to be from representatives for Ms. Scott had targeted roughly 190,000 email accounts belonging to its customers. The company began seeing the scam after Ms. Scott’s announcement on Dec. 15 of nearly $4.2 billion in donations.

Now, months after she set up an account at a bank that does not exist, Ms. Churchill is aware of other apparent victims. She continued to watch the Facebook pages purporting to belong to Ms. Scott, and would notice people asking for help in the comments. Then the comments would disappear. One man posted photographs of his debit card. “Snap its back and front and the location of the bank,” read the instructions next to a smiling photo of Ms. Scott.

And on Ms. Scott’s Medium post from December announcing her latest grants, one man posted a comment asking about the same supposed business manager who solicited funds from Ms. Churchill.

Marti DeLiema, a professor at the School of Social Work at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, said the method that Ms. Scott used, notifying groups of a grant essentially out of the blue, was ripe for scammers to exploit.

“What a gift she’s given them by this crazy way of giving that she’s developed,” Professor DeLiema said.

Even people with Ms. Scott’s resources can’t prevent swindlers from using their names. Scammers have copied the webpage of the federal Small Business Administration and impersonated the Federal Trade Commission, one of the agencies trying to combat exactly these sorts of cons.

Ms. Scott gives to institutions — universities, food banks, other frontline charities — not individuals. She has no accounts on social media like Facebook and Instagram, only her Medium page and a verified Twitter account with just three tweets. Her organization would never request fees upfront from grant recipients, a person with knowledge of her giving said. The person declined to comment directly on online deception taking place in Ms. Scott’s name or what actions she might take to help prevent it.

Ms. Churchill did more research and realized it was highly unlikely that Ms. Scott had been in touch with her directly, but still she could not cut herself off from the scammers right away. She had invested everything she could pull together in unlocking those promised funds.",1619337710.0,1
"“My son needs it for a better life. And I have already lost so much,” she said at the time.

Ms. Churchill shared dozens of screenshots and web pages, unveiling a complex network invented to prey on the hopes of the needy. She said the scammers had known that she had no money, that she was borrowing from her grandmother and her sister to cover the mushrooming fees.

After a few weeks, Ms. Churchill went to the local police. They told her that she had been conned and that there was no way to get her money back.

“This experience has ruined my life, to be honest,” she said.

She had already been struggling. Raising five children largely on her own, she relies on government support. Her mother is nearby in Sydney, but she is on dialysis and not able to help much. After Lachlan, her third born, received a diagnosis of autism, doctors said he needed specialized schooling and interventions she could not afford. Her GoFundMe page raised less than $500.

At the time the message from the “MacKenzie Scott Foundation” appeared in her inbox Ms. Churchill seemed to be in the kind of emotional distress that makes people more vulnerable to scammers, said Stacey Wood, professor of psychology at Scripps College.

Experts say one of the best ways to prevent this kind of fraud is for people to come forward, but most victims are overcome with shame, blaming themselves rather than the criminals, and remain silent.

When she was first approached, Ms. Churchill didn’t see any warnings from anyone else who had been scammed. The only web presence she found that appeared to be for Ms. Scott was a Facebook page filled with pictures of the billionaire and news articles about her generous giving.

Ms. Churchill sent a Facebook message to the administrator of this page, inquiring whether the email she received was real. Someone claiming to be Ms. Scott herself answered promptly, telling Ms. Churchill that the initial messages were from scammers pretending to be her but that she could help Ms. Churchill now that they were directly in touch.

Ms. Churchill was directed to a website for Investors Bank and Trust. It looked like a professionally designed site with slick photos, an email address, a phone number with an area code in New Jersey and an address in Los Angeles. Ms. Churchill set up an online profile, choosing a user ID and password, agreeing to the terms of service. The money quickly showed up, $250,000 in what she believed was her Investors Bank and Trust account.

The purpose of the phony bank site is to convince victims that the money is already theirs. Experts who track scams call it “flashing.” Membership fees, account fees, tax codes, transfer fees — there was a succession of payments that Ms. Churchill had to make to unlock the $250,000 in the account.

The scammers told Ms. Churchill how to download the Bitcoin Wallet app to send them the money. Whereas a bank could have tried to help her recover the funds, once she hit “send” on the cryptocurrency, her money — Bitcoin transfers totaling $10,400 in Australian dollars — was gone for good.

Scammer rings based in West Africa often use fake banks, said Steve Baker, international investigations specialist at the Better Business Bureau. The domain for Investors Bank and Trust is hosted by a Nigerian company, Whogohost, which bills itself as “the largest web hosting company in Nigeria and the West African region.”

“Unfortunately, people believe that everybody should be able to instantly recognize a scam, the scammers are dumb,” said Mr. Baker, who writes an email newsletter about fraud. “These folks are very often organized criminal gangs.”

Once a group has gotten all that it can from a victim, it will often sell the person’s details. Ms. Churchill soon found herself receiving a host of messages, one purporting to be from the International Monetary Fund and another from a woman in Congo who needed help selling gold.

“It’s not a single scam involving one lone wolf,” said Kari-Anne Liebling at ScamSurvivors, a group where volunteers track online schemes. “After the initial point, the victim is scammed into another scam and another scam and another scam.”

Professor DeLiema said prominent philanthropists should do more to protect people from falling victim to scammers operating in their name by warning that they would never ask anyone to provide payment to receive a gift.

It’s not an unheard-of step. Charles F. Feeney, who made a fortune from his Duty Free Shoppers stores, gave away billions of dollars through Atlantic Philanthropies, until closing its doors last year. His philanthropy has just such a warning on its web page. “Do not send money or provide any personal or bank account information,” it says, then lists information for making complaints to the Federal Trade Commission and the F.B.I.

Ms. Churchill has tried to alert other potential victims. She found fake accounts for Ms. Scott on Instagram, and was blocked by one after posting a comment saying it was a scam. She believes a more organized effort, by Ms. Scott herself, is needed.

“I understand she probably wants to be left alone, and I could imagine why she hasn’t got a website or anything. I could imagine all the messages she would get,” Ms. Churchill said. “Although what she’s doing is great, her not having a foundation or a website is destroying people’s lives. We matter, too.”

"&gt;The message being sent out is that it’s not up to Bitcoin to fix its glaring issues — such as energy-inefficient mining algorithms that were always going to create problems at scale — but it’s the rest of the world that must adapt. Given the huge amount of money riding on Bitcoin staying just the way it is, namely digital gold to be hoarded speculatively rather than spent efficiently, its defenders will probably keep pushing complicated workarounds, not fundamental change.

An interesting statement there have been rather vitriolic fights in the Bitcoin community over the proper way to scale the protocol, as well as the idea of it being ""digital gold to be hoarded speculatively rather than spent efficiently"". Think about the most toxic subreddit drama you have ever experienced, then multiply it by a million because many the people involved are now sudden millionaires and mistake their sudden wealth for validation of their vision.

But the net result of all the infighting is that the main Bitcoin Development team is now super paranoid, and refuses to consider any alternative ideas to their ""store of value"" vision at all.

Pay attention to Ethereum, it has similar issues both with transaction capacity and it's environmental footprint. But is taking those issues head-on and planning updates to improve on these points. It is managed much like a key network protocol for the next century, and not like an exclusive invite-only club.

Blockchain is a distributed, tamper proof, general ledger.  If you have cryptocurrency of what ever variety, and someone is selling something you want and will accept will accept your cryptocurrency in payment, you can do a direct transfer, debiting your cryptocurrency and crediting his  No intermediary like a bank is ended to facilitate the transaction.

Currency has value because people believe it does and agree is a means of exchange.  Value is based on scarcity, so what underlies a currency will be something scarce, like gold, back when.  Cryptocurrency is entirely virtual.  What might be scarce? 

*Bitcoin* is a popular form of cryptocurrency (largely because it was first in the market.) The underlying unit of value in bitcoin is called a Bitcoin. It is produced by computation, the computation requires long periods of time and enormous amount of computer power to execute. (There are huger server farms in China dedicated to it.)

BTC increases *very* slowly.  And it's deflationary.  Think of the world financial system in the days before Bretton Woods when *gold*  was the underlying value for paper currency, and there could only as much paper currency in circulation as there was gold in a country's storage (like Fort Knox in the US.)

We were w looking at high end graphic card shortages because the GPUs were well suiting to the calculations Bitcoin mining required. (Indeed, NVIDIA has announced a special card explicitly intended for this, so that the cards used by gamers can still produced and meet demand.)

I don't see creation of blockchain as requiring near that computer bower.  And semiconductor electronics has always been a boom-and-bust market.  Production saturates a market. Producers will back off as prices fall. Market saturation will be eliminated, demand will rise, and whatever it is will get produced again.  But you don't just flip a switch to turn production back on.  Restarting production of something ant a fab cannot happen quickly.

I've been watching the gyrations in the DRAM market for decades.  Now the gyrations have extended to NAND Flash underlying things like USB drives and SSDs.

Being able to store your wealth in a finite digital asset that no human or tyrannical government on the planet can inflate or steal from you (when stored correctly) is much more ""intrinsically valuable"" than anything your stupid shiny rocks are capable of.   


&gt; It literally is only valuable because you think it is. 

You can say this about literally any treasure. Baseball cards, Pokemon cards, old comic books, jewelry, all of these things are expensive not because they are ""intrinsically valuable"" but because they are rare and humans want and value them.

So you're right, Bitcoin is valuable because I and all the other Bitcoiners say so. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Metals at least have some real world application and can derive some value from those applications. 

Gold is the most expensive metal there is, it is used in jewelry and electronics, but that's not where the price comes from. The price comes from rarity. If gold was only valued based on utility, it would be much cheaper. Take for instance iron, iron is much more useful than gold but it is much cheaper because it is so abundant; iron's price ONLY comes from it's utility.

Fiat leaks value over time. How do we combat this? Well normally you buy gold. Currently inflation in assets is super high. So you see a lot of banks buying up gold with their cash reserves. So that their cash doesnt lose value over time. And if they time it right they can make a lot of money.

"McAfee got arrested for tax evasion. He's pretty much been on the run since 2012 when he fled Belize while being investigated on murder charges there. Last year he was caught in Spain, arrested for the US tax evasion charges and is awaiting extradition to the US. A significant portion of the money he didn't pay taxes on was made through some sketchy cryptocoin scheme which is separately being investigated by the SEC.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/business/mcafee-arrested-tax-evasion.html

&gt;John David McAfee, an antivirus software pioneer who fled Belize in 2012 ahead of a murder investigation there, has been arrested in Spain on tax-evasion charges, the U.S. Justice Department said on Monday.

&gt;Mr. McAfee, 75, is a Silicon Valley legend who earned millions from the computer virus-fighting software company that still bears his surname. In 2012, he disappeared from his home in Belize after the local police sought him for questioning over the death of his neighbor.

&gt;He resurfaced in Guatemala City a few weeks later, then largely dropped out of the public eye for years — until 2016, when he tried to run as a Libertarian candidate for president of the United States.

&gt;The Justice Department said on Monday that Mr. McAfee’s extradition from Spain to the United States was “pending.” It did not provide a timeline, and Mr. McAfee could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday.

&gt;Prosecutors accused Mr. McAfee of failing to file tax returns from 2014 to 2018, even as he earned millions from “promoting cryptocurrencies, consulting work, speaking engagements and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary,” according to a June indictment in the U.S. court in Tennessee that the Justice Department unsealed on Monday.

&gt;The indictment said Mr. McAfee had evaded his tax liability by accepting payments through bank accounts and cryptocurrency exchange accounts that others set up. It also said he had tried to dodge the Internal Revenue Service by dealing extensively in cryptocurrency and buying assets — including real estate and a yacht — in other people’s names.

&gt;Each count of tax evasion carries a maximum prison sentence of five years, and each count of failure to file carries a maximum one-year sentence.

&gt;A separate complaint, filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday in the Southern District of New York against Mr. McAfee and his bodyguard, Jimmy Gale Watson, provided a few more details of the U.S. government’s allegations.

&gt;It said Mr. McAfee had made more than $23 million from 2017 to 2018 by recommending several “initial coin offerings” — a type of crowdfunding — to his hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers, playing the recommendations off as impartial investment advice without disclosing that he was being paid to do so.

&gt;According to the 55-page complaint, Mr. McAfee was paid about half in Bitcoin and half in Ether, the virtual currency of the Ethereum network, a virtual cousin of Bitcoin, by the companies that were selling the securities.",1619691021.0,-1
