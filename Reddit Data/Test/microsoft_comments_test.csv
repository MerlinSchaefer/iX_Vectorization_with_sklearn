"They‚Äôre not gimping any files. You can easily change flash animation or other files into compatible formats. They are not discontinuing animate cc (formerly flash animator). They are discontinuing an obsolete plugin that is rarely used on any websites that are kept up to date. 

The government frankly shouldn‚Äôt be using flash on their websites because it‚Äôs a security risk. 

They‚Äôre doing you a favour removing the plugin so that there are fewer security risks for you, the consumer, since due to them no longer doing security updates, it is a huge fucking risk on your computer.

The point is that large enough fines can and do regulate behavior.

In the private sector, too, companies that were focused on election security, like FireEye and Microsoft, are now revealing that they were breached as part of the larger supply chain attack.

To me, the NYT is saying that because we focused on election security maybe we didn't spend time on future security initiatives that don't currently exist, the Verge snippet makes it sound more like we diverted resources from some sort of program that already exists.

Neither address the actual important part, which is that the US Government doesn't play really ANY part in that supply chain security (at least not in a direct sense).  It was a private company, the USG doesn't have servers on prem at private companies, they hold zero responsibility for this particular supply chain.

Once a Solarwinds customer installed the infected version, it would obtain the domain information from the network it was on and send that information back to a callback server encoded. They likely know all the companies they were able to get infected product into. 

Since they had Orion access, they likely also got all credentials that Orion had at each company, including SNMP, SSH and Windows Credentials. We'll likely have a hard time truly identifying if the malicious actors took any actions in many of the affected these companies. Companies like Microsoft, FireEye and the government will do very thorough investigations and we've see the reports. However, numerous other companies we may never have any idea.

"I played a role on being one of the first few to hack the PS3 back in the day.

Once a kernel level malware has infected something, you really have no idea what they have done at this point. The entire infrastructure basically has to be redone. It is very different than a Windows or MAC user being infected as they can just clean install a new OS and most kernel level malware can be undone with a malware program cleaner.

Seeing how they implemented a backdoor, and against a large company that has eyes on political power, that means they have a ridiculous amount of access to their networks and are out of the league of the average hacker. This backdoor went undetected for MONTHS. A clean install of their OS isn't going to help them if the hacker(s) are hacking an organization like this.

On top of that, the actual infection could also be on the network itself. This is unlikely as Microsoft, an OS, has been talking about it which is why I think it was a kernel level attack(having the ability to infect a user update is a ridiculous amount of power). 

Homeland Security could have been talking to the Department of State or the hacker(s). 

Solarwind is a massive company with a lot of clients that most likely pay a pretty penny, for reference... The Sony 2011 hack costed them $170m in damages- they were down $3.1 BILLION that year. Solarwind has a lot of big name clients so a massive investigation has to take place on all of those organizations. 

The hacker(s) can also turn around and say: ""$10B for all the information we have or we release it to the public and we'll tell everyone how we did it."" Hacking companies, and them taking their information hostage, is a common phenomenon. The hacker(s) generally have nothing to lose in this situation so companies always pay up.",1609731640,1
"Here's one off the wall solution that could maybe work:

1. implement federal legislation that fines US companies that sit on known security vulnerabilities and breaches without fixing them in a short period of time. Make it painful (as a % of revenue, or something), and make CEOs *personally* financially liable, or something.
2. retool the NSA to continuously pentest US companies and force them to always report their findings to the US cybersecurity division for enforcement.
3. Do the same as 1) w/ all US federal and state agencies but instead of fines just cut their budget and/or fire people.

If you did this I think you'd find that *pretty much* all the known security vulnerabilities, unknown security vulnerabilities, and general lack of security culture in US companies, vendors, and contractors would pretty rapidly disappear. It would also give the NSA something useful to do besides spying on people, and might help correct some of the harmful incentives within that and other agencies, ie. the ""we know there's a vulnerability in US service / infrastructure XYZ, but we're actively exploiting it to do our jobs more easily, and *may* be going around to make and/or enlarge some of these holes in the first place..."".

Anyways, if the options for a CEO are either a) take computer security very very seriously at *all* levels of corporate leadership and engineering, b) face a metaphorical firing squad of the US justice system and/or your own investors, this problem would be pretty self-correcting, I'd think.

TLDR; make having insecure computer systems illegal, and enforce it, and with the right incentives and enforcement mechanisms this would probably even work!

The real issue w/ US cybersecurity *at all levels of corporate + public sector organizations* ***is not a technical problem***\*. It's a ""everyone is really f---ing terrible at doing their jobs and there are no incentives in place to force them to do their jobs properly"" problem.

\* if you could make everyone stop using microsoft windows for literally anything (except pc gaming) and switch to open-source software written by people that know what the hell they're doing, and that is *not* built on 25 layers of byzantine fully opaque crap, *that* would probably help, but other than that...",1609755081,-1

"Totally. 

Short answer: I started this tiny [startup](https://tinncann.com) (shameless plug) as a side-project in July and it immediately captured more of my imagination than I could ignore.

Longer answer that you probably weren't asking for: Like you, I was really driven to work for a company like Microsoft. I was 26 when I got the job as an enterprise software architect and it immediately exceeded all of my expectations. It made my family proud...it made me proud...I got to play with cool tech...work among smart co-workers...got amazing benefits and even more amazing pay. I got a $100,000 year-end bonus, *post-tax*, when I was 27 ffs. Wild. But as time went on, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was unhappy. Some of the things about my job that looked good on paper were unsatisfying in practice. Great stability made it feel like I wasn't taking risk. Working with some of the world's biggest companies made it feel challenging to have an impact. And the feeling of low-impact, whether real or perceived, sometimes made that great pay feel unearned. So, when the opportunity presented itself, I made the leap to try my hand at startup-land. Microsoft put me in a financial position to make this move, though, and their presence on my resume gives me the added comfort of being able to get a good job if I ever one, so I definitely feel some gratitude towards the company.

In summary, I made the right decision by pursuing and landing a job there, but life would have been a lot easier if I were willing to accept that the thing that I thought would make me happy didn't always actually make me happy. And I see/saw a lot of other people chasing FAANG and Microsoft fall into the same trap.",1609785114,1

"You talking household names for European or Americans lol? And I'm sure you heard of Spotify (Swedish) and Skype (Estonian).

Companies like Skyscanner (UK) and Zalando (German) (online clothes shopping, I believe they're Europe only) are also household names here.

And international tech giants like Microsoft, Google and Amazon often buy the European tech companies, but keep a significant part of their development in Europe.

Finance software such as SAP and Microsoft Dynamics are all developed in Europe (Heidelberg and Copenhagen respectively), support software like Zendesk (Danish), and of course we have _manufacturing_ of tech such as Nokia (Finnish), Ericsson (Swedish), Philips (German), Siemens (German), Bosch (German) and Logitech (Swiss)

And of course we have well known game manufacturer like Rovio (Angry Birds, Finnish), Mojang (Minecraft, Swedish), King (Candy Crush, Swedish)

Nothing about unions prevents innovation. I'd almost say it's the opposite, as a safety net for employees means that it's easier to take risk and work for a start-up since if the company were to go under you'll not lose any pay, you'll have unemployment covered and the union will help you find a new job as well.

"So this is actually a pretty loaded question, but I'll try to give a short answer, using generalities. I don't think that you're missing something US-specific. I think you're missing something sector and company-specific. 

Some of the potential upsides of unionization are:

* Higher pay through collective bargaining
* Better benefits
* Job security
* Worker protections

Some of the potential downsides of unionization are:

* Loss of individual autonomy (this can be considered a pro, in some cases)
* Less competitive hiring, advancement (this can be considered a pro, in some cases)
* Decreased innovation / stock price. Investors on the public market have shown a lack of interest in unionized companies for a long time.

The thing is, Microsoft already offers some of the best pay, benefits, and job security among literally any company in the world. So the benefits of unionization aren't super-compelling, while the permanent downsides, coupled with an inevitable Employer/Employee battle, are hugely unappealing.

Both of these companies are massive, and the way that individual teams within them are run can vary wildly. Personally, I liked my team but I knew others in the same building and even same floor who had very different working conditions.

So as a protip for any of y'all looking for a job with a huge company, look for general employee sentiment as close as possible to the team you are looking to join. The less degrees of separation the better since every manager, manager's manager, etc. has their own style and priorities and it greatly impacts what the feel of the teams they run will be.",1609793365,1

"Easy isn't always what it is cracked up to be. Eventually, your day to day lives ends up going through the motions day in, and day out. The changes aren't dramatic or that there is little change in what you do.

Easy can potentially ""rot"" your thinking if you don't find new avenues to satisfy it. Meaning you don't want to learn new things because you don't need to. I don't know if there is a specific word for that. But your brain naturally chooses not to learn things that you don't need/think you need to.

So think of that one episode of Squidward (if you ever watched Spongebob) where he finally found his dream neighborhood that was devoid of people like Spongebob and Patrick. At first, it was perfect, he was allowed to do everything he wanted in peace, and everyone else was just like him. Eventually doing the ""easy"" life became so boring, he needed something else to do. While not completely the same, it's the same principal.

Some people may be ok with the job that they have because it is easy and pays well, but sometimes, they find things they REALLY want to do and spend their lives on.

The reason that the stock market generally doesn't like companies with unionized employees is that unionization introduces rules which lessens a company's ability to act solely in the interest of shareholders and short-term gains. This is often a major selling point for employees considering unionization.

When you start a new job, which union you're in is just one of the fields on your onboarding form. There is no ""sigma"", why should there be?

Collective bargaining for base salaries, access to salary statistics, access to specially counsel if needed that is on your side (ie not HR or someone external), as well as collectively bargained prices on things like insurance, is pretty nice.

"" Work on a project called Bergamot started in 2019 to develop client-side translation in a web browser. The project, run by several European universities and Mozilla, aims to create a translation service that preserves privacy for home users and the public sector alike.

Mozilla, maker of the Firefox web browser, ships the browser without translation functionality. While it did work on various translation features in Firefox in the past, none made it in the stable version of the browser, or at least not in enabled state.

Firefox users may install browser extensions like To Google Translate or Translate Man to add translation functionality to the browser. The big issue with these extensions is that they rely on third-party services, often by Google, Microsoft, Yandex and other companies. All of these translation services require connections to company servers, and that is a problem from a privacy point of view.

Project Bergamot aims to change that by running the translation engine locally and not in the cloud. The project team released a short demonstration video in 2019 that showed the first basic version of client-side translation running in the Firefox web browser. """,1609922083,1

So, if I was, for example, a professional video editor, or an architect, or a graphics designer, and I make my living that way, what version of windows should I use? I think professional.

As to whether this number actually signifies any value, no, it really doesn't. It's kind of like the Microsoft download completion estimate where it jumps from 2h to 5000 years and then back down to 5 minutes. I highly doubt he'd be able to convert 100% of his shares into straight cash if he wanted to, and if he did try he would basically nuke his company into oblivion overnight.

"&gt; Plus the fact that the entire internet basically runs on AWS

How irrational can you be to put that against Amazon? They didn't push other cloud computing platforms out of business, they pioneered the entire industry. You wouldn't be writing Reddit comments today if Bezos didn't pour his/his companies billions into that infrastructure, doing it successfully and thus convincing Microsoft, Google and IBM to do the same a couple years later.

You think e.g. 2010 Reddit had the cash to build and maintain their own servers? The accessibility that AWS and later competitors provide not for the end user, but the ones trying to establish new products is invaluable. Without Amazon leading the charge on affordable cloud options like that every new idea would turn out like YouTube: people get interested, traffic goes up, website owners run out of money to support the site, gotta sell it off to someone who is already sitting on either infrastructure and money, or both.

Look at Twitter, yeah, by 2010 they got their hands on enough cash to build their own infrastructure, but they would have never gotten off the ground without third party services. Same for Spotify or Instagram or a majority of all other startups, apps or websites made in the last 10+ years.

You fucking idiots are all too fucking stupid to realize that you don't actually HAVE any real privacy. You don't have any! You're tracked since birth and you fucking like it, too! You fucking stupid sheep constantly vote for MORE surveillance, not less! Isn't that the real problem here, honestly? Remember, the nsa is everywhere, they have the phones tapped, they vacuum up your sms texts, they triangulate your position and shit via your mobile phone so they know where you are at all times, they have backdoors in all cpu's and gpu's probably too, by LAW, intel and amd don't get shit to say in this matter and every time it's discovered that they have put back-doors in the cpu's, they merely just create new ones and patch out the old ones, they probably have already cracked whatsapp and are really just not telling us about it, like they obviously don't do with their various cpu backdoors and the like, and let's not forget about microsoft, the company that vacuums up every single thing you do on your pc to begin with, you think you have any privacy on win10? Really? You're a special kind of stupid, aren't ya? And what about the ifruit phones in general? Also cracked, that shit got filled up with backdoors a long time ago. In fact, I'm pretty sure that no self-respecting country is and have ever allowed its' citizen REAL privacy. Ever. Because that's just how ""governments"" roll, they fear their citizens, they fear that they might eventually revolt against the system, they fear that some smooth-talker might convince the citizens that revolting against their masters are in their best interests and thus they constantly surveil their own citizens, for their ""own good"", really. I remember a story about how, when the telephone was first invented, it took about two months for the government to crack that bitch wide open, that's how long the dude who invented the telephone was allowed full privacy on it. And the dumbest part of it all of course is, that the PEOPLE themselves, don't want actual privacy. We could all have actual, real, privacy tomorrow if we wanted it, but the PEOPLE themselves just don't want it, do they??

There are two security levels you can realistically provide to the general public nowadays:

- Require the encryption password every time you start the software
- Not encrypt the database at all (obviously equivalent to encrypting it with a key which is then stored plain text)

In either case, once you got malware it's game over as it can capture keystrokes without much trouble. The former provides protection at rest, but then so does disk encryption or storing Signal's data in an encrypted container. You can solve this if you want to already, and for the masses they won't want to use that password anyhow or it wouldn't be strong enough to matter.

An example to point to would be Bitwarden. Their desktop client is available via a traditional EXE installer with their own updater and the Microsoft Store. They are otherwise identical.

"I tend to think that Whataboutism in politics discussion is often more purposefully misrepresenting the similarities between the two things discussed. Especially when those discussions are about *subjective* effects of various actors. Like, saying that one protest is OK because this other one was (i.e. even if the protests themselves are completely different in scope and reasoning).

It gets a little fuzzier, in my mind, to call something Whataboutism, when it's a discussion of legal structures, arguments as to how things should be broken up based on market share or other stats. When we have plenty of evidentiary examples to compare and contrast with.

So, the question is less to obscure or say ""look over here pay no attention to our current discussion!"" but rather ""no, really, why should Apple be treated different from Wal-Mart, when it comes to what services they should be *required* to provide or should not be *allowed* to limit?""

And like, personally, I don't think Apple should be able to limit what you can install on their devices. Right to Repair, etc. And maybe Wal-Mart *isn't* the best analogy (I think that can serve as a jumping off point to discovering what a *better* analogy might be). And in that, maybe we should be looking at other companies like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, and how they sell similar devices that you can't install your own software on (console game machines).

"The maps argument doesn‚Äôt really add up. In order to use Apple Maps you have to have an Apple product. It‚Äôs a value add (and you can still install third party apps). This is a bit like saying your car manufacturer is using their power in the car market to dominate the stereo market because your car comes with a built-in stereo, which is clearly absurd.

One thing that‚Äôs important to bear in mind is that US antitrust laws specifically state that you can‚Äôt call a company a monopoly just because they have the best product and mop the floor with the competition. While Apple does clearly advantage its own apps by including them by default, it‚Äôs still not clear that this is monopolistic - users expect smartphones to come with basic features like messaging and email.

In the Microsoft antitrust case over Internet Explorer, the final ruling wasn‚Äôt that it was illegal to bundle a web browser with an operating system, it was that Microsoft needed to expose its APIs so that other browsers were competing on a level playing field.

Then Google also has both YouTube and Googledocs(the biggest competitor to word processors) and practically another monopoly from its Search engine. Then there is Apple with ITunes, splitting the computer market with Microsoft.

You said

Very unlikely. Many developer machines would have partial of even full copies of the source, and if they're using git (which I'd give a fair chance, unless they're so tightly stuck with some legacy source control product that they couldn't switch over years ago), then every developer machine would have cryptographic hashes derived from recent changes. If they modified any of the code, all of those developers would immediately get errors when trying to merge their own changes back in, prompting investigation.

So, they'd need to infiltrate every server, developer desktop, every laptop that might not be plugged into the network more than once every few months, and synchronize the change across them all to have a reasonable chance of escaping undetected.

It'd be far easier to copy details about known bugs that haven't been fixed yet (especially in something like windows 7, which is out of support (unless you pay big money) but still in active use by a lot of stubborn users) and use those than to successfully sneak your own exploit into the system.",1610254814,1

"This was literally division in action, and Redditors celebrated it. Then they complained about how divisive the US was/is over the next 3 years.

The division was caused by the actions that everyone here supported. Redditors celebrated as these companies separated us into our bubble because we didn't like to see people who disagreed with us. And once they were gone, both them and us became more rooted in our beliefs, good and bad. 

Without dissenting opinions, beliefs march towards the extremes, which is almost always a worse place to be. 

Companies talk about ""diversity"" fostering better environments, and that people provide different perspectives on issues and problems. By removing the entire right-wing perspective, news is presented with a complete bias. All news is biased in some way, whether intentionally or unintentionally, having people who inherently want to find a way to disprove the article are helpful for identifying flaws or half-truths in an article and coming closer to reality. Without dissenting opinions, people take news at complete face value, any article, no matter what, if it supports what we support, it must be 100% factually correct. People should know that's bullshit, but they want to believe, so they just do.

I think the actions that tech companies are showing over the past few days will have serious ramifications over the coming weeks, and I expect there to be further purges of right-wing subreddits, /r/conspiracy is number 1 on the chopping block, and perhaps even /r/Conservative. These actions embolden tech companies, which are largely left-wing companies run by left-wing people, to take further action. The internet is almost universally controlled by a small handful of private companies. These companies hold your speech in their hands. If they don't want what you say to exist, they can essentially make it so. If Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, IBM, Twitter, Facebook, and Oracle decide they don't like what you're saying, you've essentially been silenced. It's akin to saying ""Sure, you have free speech, if you're in your own house, by yourself.""

I firmly believe that these companies are the modern day press, and modern day street corner, and that freedom of speech should be required on these websites. It is far too easy for companies to essentially form an equivalent of the Great Firewall for anything they personally don't agree with. And no, I don't think that what Trump is/was saying isn't dangerous. I agreed with the temporary muting of his account, but I'm worried about where this will stop. I don't want to see a future where the internet is only left-wing opinions that are acceptable by whoever works in Silicon Valley. Difference of opinions are what allow people to challenge themselves, come to a combined understanding, and hopefully come away having learned something and possibly changed their mind. If everyone just circlejerks over their shared opinions, we aren't improving or advancing at all.

As a strong supporter of freedom of speech, I am afraid of what the future of the internet and freedom of speech will be. It's unfortunate that freedom of speech advocating platforms are largely right-wing, because much of their content I don't agree with, but I still believe they should be allowed to say it.",1610279785,1

"Alright, sure.

&gt;when they actually do find election fraud?

When there are actual instances of voter fraud, those people are charged and convicted. The rate at which fraud occurs and the impact it has on elections in the US is hard to measure, but my understanding is that the impact is marginal at best. 

Even if we take something like the [Heritage Foundation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/pacei-voterfraudcases.pdf) sample of voter fraud (which, to be extremely clear, I am assuming is biased and inaccurate due to the source) we can see that charges and convictions are made. So what's the issue? It certainly seems like when there are actual instances of voter fraud, it's generally found relatively quickly and corrected.

Trump's own [AG](https://apnews.com/article/barr-no-widespread-election-fraud-b1f1488796c9a98c4b1a9061a6c7f49d) claiming there is no widespread fraud:

&gt;Barr told the AP that U.S. attorneys and FBI agents have been working to follow up specific complaints and information they‚Äôve received, but ‚Äúto date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.‚Äù

To be clear, we *have* found election fraud, but [almost never](https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-55016029) in the way that Trump and his sycophants are spewing.

Further, here's some great resources on just how insignificant voter fraud actually is:

[Justin Levitt, ‚ÄúThe Truth About Voter Fraud,‚Äù Brennan Center for Justice, 2007.](https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/truth-about-voter-fraud)

&gt;This report found that most reported incidents of voter fraud are actually traceable to other sources, such as clerical errors or bad data matching practices. The report reviewed elections that had been meticulously studied for voter fraud, and found incident rates between 0.0003 percent and 0.0025 percent. Thus, the report found, it is more likely an American ‚Äúwill be struck by lightning than that he will impersonate another voter at the polls.‚Äù

[Sharad Goel, Marc Meredith, Michael Morse, David Rothschild, Houshmand Shirani-Mehr, ‚ÄúOne Person, One Vote: Estimating the Prevalence of Double Voting in U.S. Presidential Elections,‚Äù Jan. 13, 2017.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fokd83nn4x6wuw9/OnePersonOneVote.pdf?dl=0)

&gt;This working paper, by scholars affiliated with Stanford, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard, Yale, and Microsoft Research, assessed the possibility of ‚Äúdouble voting,‚Äù or an individual voting twice. It concluded that that the upper limit on double voting in the 2012 election was 0.02%. The paper also noted that the incident rate was likely much lower, given audits conducted by the researchers showed that ‚Äúmany, if not all, of these apparent double votes could be a result of measurement error.‚Äù

Again, just so we are clear. If at some point in the future we go through the data and it turns out that there actually was a huge amount of fraud in the 2020 elections, I would be happy to change my mind. Thus far, I am not convinced.

You seem to feel pretty strongly about this, how about we put some money on it? I'll bet you 300 bucks that within the next 3 years (ample time to work through the data for some initial analysis) there will be no more or less ""voter fraud"" in this election than there has been in any other.

Amazon built a building, filled it with computers and networking equipment, connected it to utilities, and are now renting the computers out through AWS.

Comcast moves data from building to building.  They are renting space on their transmission lines.  Net neutrality means that space on the transmission line cannot get special priority if you pay more.  It is important because the big ISPs have near monopolies over parts of the US.

If Comcast stops your traffic, you are fully off the internet to some users in monopoly markets.  There is no way to get around it.

If AWS stops renting to you, you can rent from someone else.  Apple, Google and Microsoft have competing products.  Smaller companies like Rackspace let you buy your own physical hardware and put it in their buildings.

I don't love tech consolidation, but the idea that they're telling us what we can read is absurd. As others have pointed out \_\_in this thread\_\_ there are plenty of other places people can go if they want to hate Democrats and jews. Telegram, [REDACTED], gab, 8chan, just to name a few.  

&amp;#x200B;

These tech companies have de-facto control over \_\_checks notes\_\_ like two means of communication. If these people want to meet up in person, buy books, sky write, use IRC, distribute an unsigned Android app, get hosted in like any other country, host their own servers, go on the dark web, send pamphlets, have zoom meetings, do Skype, Microsoft Teams, smoke signals, HAM radio, whatever, they can. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; The real problem isn't the idea that a business can choose with whom it does business. In general, I think that's a fine idea, provided those business aren't discriminating on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;The real problem here is the fact that we have an oligarchy of megacorporations and megabillionaires. If we had a truly free marketplace, where there were hundreds of cloud providers, and they didn't act in lockstep with each other, there'd be no problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

There a surprising amount of competition in the cloud services space considering it takes hundreds of millions of dollars to set up the software and hardware infrastructure for distributed cloud computing. The market is free, it's just high entry cost. 

&amp;#x200B;

Your problem seems to be that the few people in the market‚Ä¶agree that selling services to nazis is bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Cloud A would decide they just don't like Parler, don't want to do business with them, and boot them. They'd just head over to cloud B and everything's fine.

&amp;#x200B;

But if B, C, D, E, and F also don't want to sell you services, either because they don't like what you're doing, or because of political pressure then you seem to still have an issue with it. If six different cloud services companies don't want your business because you're a toxic threat to democracy \_maybe\_ your business model is the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; The problem is that there are two companies who, acting together, can prevent you from having a mobile app. 

&amp;#x200B;

You can side load on to Android. No one can actually prevent you from having an Android app. You just may not be in the Play or Amazon stores. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;There are six companies who, if they act in lockstep, can prevent you from using cloud infrastructure. There are similarly small numbers of companies who can prevent you from effectively caching content, processing payments, and all of the other stuff necessary to communicate to a non-trivial audience on the Internet.

&amp;#x200B;

So again. Your problem is that a bunch of companies happen to agree that Parler is bad. And your solution is more companies, until one of those companies agrees to do business with Parler. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's not a viable solution for a number of reasons, the high cost associated with creating these businesses being one. But again, it presupposes that 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Parler is somehow entitled to operate exactly in the manner it wishes; and 

2. That company Z, who finally want to do business with them will never change their mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; And, we now clearly see that these companies do act in lockstep. These megabillionaires' interests are aligned, and they are not our interests, even if we happen to be on the same page about hating Trump, nazis, and political violence. Why are you confident they won't use this power to silence speech you do like? Say, speech about forming workers' unions, or using alternative services to theirs?

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't \_just\_ that these companies feel a way. It's also concerted political pressure from the moment, from their boards, and employees, and from the general public. These decisions are not made in a vacuum. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; That's the problem with free speech: when it's infringed on, it'll always be abhorrent speech that infringed on first. Because 99.9% of people hate nazis, so making nazis STFU is something that's very attractive to almost everyone. But if you give someone the power to do that, they'll have that same power to make anyone else STFU for any reason they see fit, too.

&amp;#x200B;

And if Amazon deplatforms all labor unions, they'd catch hell for it. And another cloud service would host them. Because labor unions aren't using AWS to threaten to kill members of congress. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; 

\&gt; Here are the arguments I always see about why this OK and why I think they don't work:

\&gt; 

\&gt;     Free speech is about governments, private companies can do whatever they like.

\&gt;         No, the 1st amendment is strictly about governments. Free speech is a broader concept. If the government permits any and all speech, but six corporations acting in unison have the power to effectively silence you, and they act in concert to do so in opaque ways, then that's absolutely a free speech issue. We've lost the ability to communicate freely: it just happens that a corporate oligarchy did it, not the government, but the consequences are the same.

&amp;#x200B;

You lose the ability to freely communicate only through the platforms that those companies control. See above.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Free speech doesn't mean speech without consequences.

\&gt; That's correct, but it's also not the argument. People on Parler or whatever service should be held accountable for breaking the law there. Incitement to violence and conspiracy to commit terrorism are already very illegal. We should not expect (or want) the megacorporations to unilaterally and opaquely enforce these laws, we should expect and want or government to enforce them. This is because when our government enforces them, they have to prove their case in court, and they're accountable to our system of checks and balances; they can't make arbitrary and opaque decisions completely unaccountably like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos can.

&amp;#x200B;

You conflate consequences for ""legal consequences."" If someone in my non-profit theater wants to stand up and say all women are terrible actors and we should go back to shakespearean times where all roles were played by men, I can and should kick him the hell out of my theater. Look, a consequence that didn't violate the first amendment. Did it violate his free speech as you define it. Sure. But as you said, free speech doesn't mean speech without consequences.",1610325845,-1
"I wrote this reply to the original reply from you I saw in my inbox, which I guess you deleted?  Just pasting it -- I haven't checked if you changed anything between that reply and this one, so sorry if I'm replying to stuff that you didn't want replied to.

&gt; Well, I'm about to waste a good 30 minutes of my life.

Thanks for taking the time to have a reasonable conversation about it.

&gt; I'm anti-fascist, pro-democracy, and very happy about this. Because of the tolerance paradox.

I thought about including a pre-emptive response about tolerance paradox but thought I'd wait and see if anyone replied with it first since I think it's one of the better arguments against my position and it takes time to reply to.  My main thought about it is that it's not real: we don't have examples from history of repressive governments being installed as a consequence of having too much free speech.  I don't agree that free speech is either a sufficient or necessary condition for developing fascism.  We do, though, have endless examples of repressive governments suppressing speech as a method for acquiring and maintaining control.  Besides, the sorts of speech we're mainly concerned about are *already illegal*: incitement to violence, conspiring to commit terrorism, and so on.  We don't need to give the government (or our corporate oligarchs) any *additional* power to protect ourselves against this possible future.  And in fact, allowing our corporate oligarchs the power to moderate our political speech is a pretty good way to bring that future about.

&gt;  People aren't radicalized in a vacuum. We don't need to tolerate or platform speech which incites people to violence, radicalizes them against political opponents, racial, ethnic, or religious minorities.

Incitement to violence is already illegal.  While I'd love to have a way to prevent people from developing racial hatred, etc, there's no practical method for enforcing that via speech controls without doing more harm than good.  Certainly handing the tech billionaires the keys to our democracy isn't a good way to do it.

&gt; I don't love tech consolidation, but the idea that they're telling us what we can read is absurd. As others have pointed out in this thread there are plenty of other places people can go if they want to hate Democrats and jews. Telegram, td.win, gab, 8chan, just to name a few.

But it sounds like you'd be happy if all of those places you list were shutdown by the tech oligarchs today, too?

&gt; These tech companies have de-facto control over checks notes like two means of communication. If these people want to meet up in person, buy books, sky write, use IRC, distribute an unsigned Android app, get hosted in like any other country, host their own servers, go on the dark web, send pamphlets, have zoom meetings, do Skype, Microsoft Teams, smoke signals, HAM radio, whatever, they can.

As I said in my original comment, the events of the past couple of days expose this lie.  The mobile app example alone should be troubling to anyone who cares about civil rights.  It's not reasonable to expect people to switch from ios to android and sideload an app to be able to access certain otherwise-legal political speech.  In general, our courts reject these arguments (that a right is intact if there are other ways to exercise it even if the law in question removes one/some of those ways).
 
&gt; There a surprising amount of competition in the cloud services space considering it takes hundreds of millions of dollars to set up the software and hardware infrastructure for distributed cloud computing. The market is free, it's just high entry cost.

It's an effective monopoly controlled by a handful of companies that are now acting in unison on this issue.  There aren't nearly enough viable competitors for it to be an effective market.  And, crucially, nor will there ever be.  Partly because of that high entry cost you mention, but also because if a new company does start showing success, it'll just be bought by one of the existing dominant companies.

&gt; Your problem seems to be that the few people in the market‚Ä¶agree that selling services to nazis is bad.

The problem is that the market is dominated entirely by about half a dozen companies who are acting together to decide, in an unaccountable way, who is and isn't worthy of having a voice.

&gt; But if B, C, D, E, and F also don't want to sell you services, either because they don't like what you're doing, or because of political pressure then you seem to still have an issue with it. If six different cloud services companies don't want your business because you're a toxic threat to democracy maybe your business model is the problem.

All six companies in question also have a stake in not having their workers unionize and in preventing new competitors from emerging.  Are you OK with them suppressing speech that furthers *those* goals too, by the same argument?  I.e., that if all six companies agree something should be silenced, it should be silenced? 

&gt; You can side load on to Android. No one can actually prevent you from having an Android app. You just may not be in the Play or Amazon stores.

I addressed this above.

&gt; So again. Your problem is that a bunch of companies happen to agree that Parler is bad. And your solution is more companies, until one of those companies agrees to do business with Parler.

I addressed this above, too.

&gt; This isn't just that these companies feel a way. It's also concerted political pressure from the moment, from their boards, and employees, and from the general public. These decisions are not made in a vacuum.

The companies are in control.  I didn't elect their boards and employees, and I don't want my democracy in their control.

&gt; And if Amazon deplatforms all labor unions, they'd catch hell for it. And another cloud service would host them. Because labor unions aren't using AWS to threaten to kill members of congress.

How would you even know if Google, Twitter, or Youtube were demoting pro-union content?  Parler, as a company, didn't threaten to kill anyone.  Some people used their open platform to do that (while also using it for other legitimate purposes).  Users have used (and continue to use) reddit to do the same.  Threatening to kill someone is illegal.  It's a job for our legal system to determine if someone did that and punish them for it.

&gt; You lose the ability to freely communicate only through the platforms that those companies control. See above.

I address this above.

&gt; You conflate consequences for ""legal consequences."" If someone in my non-profit theater wants to stand up and say all women are terrible actors and we should go back to shakespearean times where all roles were played by men, I can and should kick him the hell out of my theater. Look, a consequence that didn't violate the first amendment. Did it violate his free speech as you define it. Sure. But as you said, free speech doesn't mean speech without consequences.

Again, kicking someone disruptive out of your theater is fine.  Even if there were just 1 theater company in the world, it'd be fine to kick someone who was shouting during performances, since it prevents the other people in the audience from enjoying the show they paid for.  But that's not what's happening here.  If you don't want to hear what people on Parler are saying, don't use Parler.  But that's not what you want.  You want no one to be able to use it.",1610327843,-1
"First, they are not trying to ""de-platform the entire part of the political spectrum"". These people are welcome to talk on Twitter or r/conservatives etc. In fact any person who posts a liberal comment on r/conservative is instantly banned, as it seems to be the sub-reddit's prerogative, but because the subreddit follows the TOS, unlike r/the_donald, people find other places to post and no-one is rallying for r/conservative to be banned.

These people are either moving to Parler because they don't agree with the direction that Twitter, Facebook, etc are going ( ""fake news!"", ""Liberal supression""), or it's because they are talking about stuff that will get them banned on other platforms (inciting violence, a la our Grand Leader Trump) which is their right. Fox News, Newsmax and One America are all still in business, last I checked.

Nobody is banning people for general discussion from either side of the political spectrum. However, inciting violence and spreading blatant misinformation is not being tolerated and to not put up with those types of comments is the tech company's prerogative and more than legal. As I have stated replying to other comments in this thread, as long as it's not discriminatory to a protected group (ie race, religion, etc. and I don't think Republican/conservatives count, last I checked) then the company can refuse service or enforce any rules they want legally. If a coffee shot wanted to only allow in people wearing a kilt (or a mask, regardless of state laws etc), they have every right to, but they deal with the consequences (less traffic and potential boycotting/blowback from out raged fashionistas).

To suggest that Google has any obligation to put the app on their store or host their servers is ridiculous. They are more than welcome to host their own site. Two examples, Minecraft exploded to popularity long before being posted to a store/launcher (ie steam), purely on word of mouth and gained enough momentum to sell to Microsoft for 1 billion dollars. Not allowing an app in their app store is not ""suppressing opinions"" by any means. They still have the whole internet to appeal to. A second example would be Pirate Bay. The site has had to migrate hosts many times through the years because, though the site is perfectly legal (P2P torrent tracker), many of their users are using it for questionably legal purposes.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, with regards to 

&gt;They also have gone on the offensive to shut down third party providers and hosts. 

I would like to see reference material for that. That kind of behavior should not be tolerated and regulation is an option that I can get behind personally. However, that fact has nothing to do with the first argument about a private company being forced to accept the patronage of anyone who wants to use their services or how misinformation and hate speech fall under free speech protections. At best it's a conflation of two completely separate arguments. At worse, it's an intentionally bad faith [false cause](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/false-cause) or [ad hominem](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/ad-hominem) argument.",1610337504,-1
"AWS is a big player but nothing like a monopoly in the cloud services space.

"So let me explain net neutrality as it actually is. Net neutrality as proposed, only applied to ISPs. Amazon/google/apple/fb all completely uninhibited. Net neutrality was about marketing analytics. Google apple Microsoft and fb make hundreds of millions (google billions) off of selling ad revenue based on targeted after rising. When you go to google and bing, the second the site is up and run It is monitoring every keystroke and mouse placement in the browser. It knows where you hovered your
Mouse and for how long, what you typed and deleted, it‚Äôs all collected under ‚Äúsession activity‚Äù and you agreed to it in their ToS. ISPs collect everything you do traffic wise, but they don‚Äôt track things you don‚Äôt submit, if you type up a diatribe outlining your anger towards a politician, but you don‚Äôt hit submit, the ISP doesn‚Äôt have that info, FB or other social media does have that info. That helps their advertising for clients. The reason the big tech companies wanted net neutrality wasn‚Äôt to help consumers, it was to eliminate literally their only competition for internet marketing revenue. Amazon for instance before net neutrality, through their AWS, gives their clients faster network access to their clients, that means their clients get faster access to data than those that aren‚Äôt their clients that is ‚Äútolling‚Äù the internet that they said net neutrality was meant to stop, except that net neutrality doesn‚Äôt stop Amazon from doing that, only ISPs. Internet based corporations have almost no restrictions from net neutrality, only ISPs which creates less competition.  Net neutrality wasn‚Äôt a valid answer to the issue. A law saying no company can restrict internet access and bandwidth speed was what was needed, but google/Microsoft/apple/fb would never agree to that",1610339809,-1
"I still think you‚Äôre wrong. By any flavor of mercantilism throughout history, the store owner  sets the price for the product. The price they pay to the manufacturer is far less, as they also pay the cost of selling the manufacturer‚Äôs product, provide the venue, support, and require a profit. Apple and Google are doing the same thing, even though there isn‚Äôt a physical good. There are costs to both. Server farms, AWS, interstate and intercontinental banking. 

I want to buy my apps from a vendor I trust. You can buy yours from a different store if you prefer a more relaxed application of OS updates and app curation. The market determined that there are two insanely successful platforms. Microsoft tried and failed. Programmers wisely followed the vast customer bases. Samsung will also fail. For reasons that are similar. The Chinese will do what their government tells them to do.

"I get your point. But Parler seems to be directly responsible for I inciting violence, in which case it‚Äôs not really a free speech issue, more akin to yelling ‚Äúfire‚Äù in a crowded theatre.

But to the other point. If Parler gets booted from AWS, what‚Äôs stopping them from going to Azure?  Microsoft doesn‚Äôt want them?  Get more coders and head to IBM, Linode, Vultr, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Open Stack, the any of the literally hundreds of data centers in the United States. If I wanted to set up a server right now, I could drive it two miles and to a co-location facility and have direct access to a fiber backbone in a managed data center. And I live in a town of 30,000 people. There are a lot more options than AWS and Google.

Even if Parler exhausts all the possible options in the US for hosting (unlikely), they can go international, and have access to thousands of other options.  If they are complaining that they are going dark because AWS is shutting them down, then they aren‚Äôt trying hard enough. 

I have some background in big data, and given a small team, even if I didn‚Äôt have access to AWS‚Äôs micro services, I could stand up something like Parler inside of a week given an existing codebase. It‚Äôs not like 2 companies control everything.",1610343248,-1

"&gt;AWS has specific APIs that you call to do things. Even if you write your code in a way that ports to other platforms, you still will need to code new implementations of the code when moving to another platform, IE Azure

Agree, I just meant that this isn't usually all that expensive if it's the only part of your system that needs to change.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There's tons of Colo datacenters that are affordable. I've looked into AWS, it doesn't exactly save money except under very specific niche use cases. And who knows if those will remain cheaper when Amazon raises their prices.  
&gt;  
&gt;Amazon's prices are low because they want to gain market share. They want to be better to Azure.  
&gt;  
&gt;25 years from now, they will behave like the aging tech companies of 2020 behave- hiking prices on a captive customer base. Just look at Oracle and LogMeIn.

I don't consider AWS to be cheaper because of their rates compared to renting/owning a physical machine (I assumed it's more expensive) but because of the time and overhead saved on operations work.

Where I work, we're spread across multiple cloud providers and luckily for us we're big enough to exert lots of pressure on the providers based on how much money we pay them. Every year, we assess whether it'd be more economical to build our own data centers and every year there's pretty wide agreement that it's cheaper (when taking all factors, overhead, additional employees we'd need to hire, etc.) to bet on the continued commoditization of cloud offerings over time. Time will tell whether we're right or not, but it seems unlikely to me AWS will be able to drive players like Microsoft out of the game. It's not like they're operating at a loss (from what I remember they're making lots of money)",1610401439,1
"In the time frame that AWS went from informing them to shutting them down, I doubt they have a copy of anything in order to do much of anything. At best, they have archived posts and even then, they won't have enough to follow through with their suit.

Also, AWS most likely has a clause that they can terminate their contract and servers at any time with minimal, to no warning. Before AWS, Google and Microsoft got their hosting services in full swing, private clouds did this all the time. I was IT for a company that did that and depending on the violation, we had a standard of 30 days for us canceling an agreement, but if they violated our ToS, we could shut them down immediately and just hand them a drive with their server backup and tell them to fuck off.",1610404222,-1

"&gt;You see that would be much more up my street. ;)

Everyone has a thing they like.  For a long time I worked with a guy who was heavy into compilers (he worked on common lisp for a number of years at CMU).

&gt;Sorry I didn't mean to be such an asshole to you, thank you for replying. The point I was really trying to make is that very often the importance on these sorts of areas is minimal compared to the ammount of time spent on this sort of thing in interview.

Yeah, it's just some basic intro/calibration questions. My interview style itself has changed quite a bit over the years.  Back in the 90s we were in full-on Microsoft brain teaser question mode.  The evolution of the interview is an interesting subject in itself.

&gt;I think in practice if a candidate has the relevant prior experience and is able to show this throughout the interview, then it can very likely be assumed that they have these skills, or else they would not have been able to get where they are.

For the most part this is true, but man have I ever ran into some counter examples.  Let's face it, engineering continues to change and a lot of what people do when programming isn't really really hardcore engineering.  It's using libraries and systems that other people have built that you may not understand.  This is why web pages take so damn long to load even though our computers are a jillion times more capable (my first PC was a 286!).  All of this means that when interviewing you have to keep in mind what you are looking for and what the job is.  

&gt;If however a candidate has not been able to naturally show they have these required skills, I would then consider asking these sorts of questions in order to let them prove that they have required skills. However I would probably remember that I was required to ask the questions to get a good picture of the candidate, regardless of how well they answered.

What's your technique behind having them show the skills?  That's the part where I always have a hard time.  Previous work?  Code samples?  Have them write a test?  

For non-programmers (e.g. artists / designers) it's almost 100% about portfolio.  Level designers I almost always have do a (paid) test which is pretty effective and can be pretty fun for all involved.  But for programmers?  Whiteboard coding is bullshit.  Written take him tests are good, but man what a time investment, wouldn't you at least want a simple screen before going there?  Code samples are potentially problematic (I've had candidates bring print outs of code from competitors to interviews before to show what they've written!).

&gt;So yeh, no doubt they are useful skills, I am just very sceptical of the importance put on them during interview processes, as opposed to the skills and experience that is truly going to be of relevance.

Not to get too long winded but I think there is also an element of interview technique here.  What I'm looking to do in an interview is qualify someone, not disqualify them.  Over the years I've asked a lot of the same questions and calibrated the results against real world results.  

Let's take the virtual function question as a starting point.  I started asking that question &gt;20 years ago.  A coworker actually came up with the question and I've just kept the tradition going (he currently is a senior engineer at google and does a lot of hiring stuff, he's a genius at this).

So let's break it down.  I'm not asking people a super insulting question about the syntax of virtual functions.  ""How are virtual functions implemented?"" assumes knowledge of the basics.  But there are an entire class of people who don't understand this question and go right to ""I know what a virtual function is"" and usually give a fairly vague description of typing ""virtual foo()"" or something like that.  The concept of ""how does the compiler implement?"" isn't really understood by them because their knowledge just isn't deep enough to get there conceptually.  These interviewees often can't get there even when it's explained to them.

So the next step is they understand what I'm talking about but flat out just have never thought about how it works.  In my experience this is where the break point is in terms of people that are serious about understanding and engineering software and those that aren't.  There is a super high correlation between those that care enough to know the next level down and people that also happen to be good engineers.  Note, I'm not saying if you don't know this stuff you aren't a good engineer, just that in my experience all the people who worked out well knew the answer to this question.

After you get the people who know nothing about it you get to the vague answer.  ""Some kind of table lookup"" boils down to the common answer at that level.  I always drill down more and give answers/prompt to figure out the depths of their understanding.  Sometimes a bit of a prompt helps them remember that they did know this stuff.  Often they get the concept of a lookup table but don't really understand how it works or how it might be laid out.  I always give them a change to design/work it out themselves and sometimes they do (this is rare though).

The next level are the people who are like ""Why are you asking me this, each class has a ptr to a vtable and each function has it's own slot"" and we can move on.  I like this answer.

I also always go through the process for calling a virtual function.  That leads into memory subsystem architecture and how long it takes to fetch memory and what that mechanism looks like on.  Many many many people who are decent programmers have little to no understanding of memory subsystem architecture so I take this part with a major grain of salt.  However, the people that nail this section are usually exceptionally good engineers, there is a high correlation to knowing this stuff and being fucking hardcore about software engineering.  Keep in mind I'm mainly talking about hiring game engine programmers here.

To get back to the philosophy part I'm just trying to correlate questions with success.  Not knowing them doesn't mean you won't be good, but knowing them cold and understanding some of this basic stuff is highly correlated with good hires in my experience.  

I also very much enjoy hearing about some of the projects people have worked on and the problems they have had to solve.  I can go on for hours about all of the different things that I've had to tackle over the years (going back to DOS days in 256 color to working on some of the first GPUs with pixel shading, to writing code on Larrabee to coding PS2 there are so many stories, love to hear other peoples).",1610474584,1

AWS and cloud hosting aren't required to run a website. You can run one off a raspberry Pi from your house if you wanted. They are not gatekeepers to the Internet.  You are arguing the equivalent of a landlord not being able to evict you for cooking meth in their house.",1610632474,1

"All these security issue can be fixed.  Given that they now have global attention, they could raise millions and build whatever they want.  All it takes is people that know what they are doing, and they can simple hire them.  I've done this for decades, you come in and build an entirely new system while keeping the old system in place.  Then you move people over to the new system.  I've been doing that since the DotCom first started.  Moving people from Novel to Microsoft servers, from MS to Oracle, you get about 50 million in funding and you can buy some pretty smart people.

It's not like Amazon has some patent on a workable feature set.  There's other players in the field and server farms have been around for quite a while now, it's not like the early days of the Internet where people can't even build a web page.  This tech is old and stable, has been for a long time and Amazon isn't the only player.  In addition schools have been teaching this for over a decade now, not many secrets on how to build a server and the features are more open source that ever before.

Can't see this taking a year, just gotta hire the right people.  You're suggesting that nobody other than Amazon knows how to build a server?  Amazon's big but plenty of others know how to build a server farm.  Even FB open sourced theirs years ago.  It's also not a heavy use like a Netflix, it's just text and pics.

&gt;Also you Seem to believe that AWS customers have 40% ""Other Views"", which they definetly dont.

Actually I don't think that at all.  What I think is that 40% of the US doesn't see that what Twitter, FB, Amazon and others are doing is right.  In fact, it's greater than 40%, but not all of them would use another platform.  It's call free speech and there's some piece of paper somewhere in DC that talks about it.


&gt;The reason why Amazon AWS is sooo big and seemingly indestructible, is because its Not Just ""throw some Servers in a room""....

I'm not suggesting to ""throw some Servers in a room"" and the reason for Amazon being so big is how they do their business.  They don't have competition in their base business.  However, that's not the point.  You're suggesting that nobody other than Amazon can build a server farm?  Anyone can and several have.  The real point is that Parler has a built in customer... Parler.

This is a chance for Parler to raise $100 million and build out their own platform, and they should.  One thing that Amazon needs is competition.

The real underlying point is that Amazon, FB, Twitter and others have silenced others.  They've done this to newspapers that ended up telling the truth.  This isn't supposed to happen and they have been given special right that others don't have.",1610634912,1
"The thing you need to understand is that AWS is not a hosting service. It's a platform.

This is sort of the equivalent of Microsoft saying ""You can no longer code your app for Windows"", so Parler has to go find out how to rewrite the entire thing to run on a Mac. Except a webapp is usually way more complicated than a desktop app. It isn't a week long project, it's a ""start from the ground up"" project.

Also, it's important to note that the ""Apple"" in this scenario won't let them develop on that platform either.

The kind of hardware to run a social media site is expensive and takes time to procure, and I don't think it's unreasonable for a company built on the cloud to not have that on hand.

"Think of what's involved in getting those servers up and running.

You can't just hook them into an existing network that isn't set up for it - it needs to be isolated from everything else that the agency is running, because you're giving access to a group of people from outside the agency (and in fact, it's a group that you explicitly don't trust.) Such isolation is not easy to set up. Then you need the servers themselves; you typically don't just have idle capacity lying around to use for something like this if you weren't prepared for it in advance. Then there's the whole matter of infrastructure; we don't know how Parler was built, but this kind of thing needs load balancers, monitoring, failure management, databases with redundancy, possibly a CDN or at least some sort of caching layer. All of this is possible given enough advanced preparation, but I doubt there was an existing team in a government agency whose job it was to set up a cloud provider that's ready to go at a moment's notice. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Cloudflare all employ thousands of (highly paid) skilled engineers to build and maintain the cloud infrastructure that is offered to clients - how is the government just going to spin that up out of the blue?

Oh right, and they have to do it without it looking like a government job even to the people at Parler who are going to be setting up the services, because while I believe the argument that the CEO could be pressured into compliance and silence, the technical people would need to be under the same conditions as well. And once you've got a dozen people who know a secret, it becomes a lot easier for one of them to anonymously leak it because they know how hard it's going to be to identify which individual did it.

To further illustrate the point: think of how much of a shitshow it was at the beginning of the pandemic. The government couldn't even get a website up that showed a graph of new cases without buckling under the load. Or how the healthcare.gov launch went. Parler is a significantly harder technical challenge than healthcare.gov.",1610978066,-1
"I think you might have missed my main point: their email host/MX records doesn't really matter. Even when using the same domain, neither transactional nor marketing email providers r (e.g: SES, Mailgun, Sengrid, MailChimp) require anything done to the MX record. 

It is not uncommon for them to be completely separate systems. Microsoft 365 could be down completely while they're still sending transaction emails and/or campaigns.  

&gt; If they were self hosting, they would use the same provider for their web DNS entries and their MX entries

That's only when the web and email are on the same provider-- which is usually a bad idea, especially with AWS. (Most good web providers have a horrible reputation on their IPs)

&gt; They have no idea what they fuck they are doing. Even really junior sys admins straight out of school or self-taught admins do a better job than they did. You're assuming the Parler IT crew know how to self host and manage mail servers? Mail servers are far more of a pain than web servers, and they can't even handle that.

Web servers and Email servers have very different skillsets. Even modern IT is becoming a different skillset (especially when they outsource Email and Web). Just because someone sets up a bad web server, doesn't mean that they'd be equally bad at Email, IT, or programming-- and the same is true the other ways.

Security, sadly, also has its separate skillsets. Just because one know how to replace a hard disk, install an OS, configure a web/email/dns server, or write coede; doesn't mean they know how to secure it. I wouldn't make any assumptions on their ability through their lack of security in one area, how that relates to others, or how that relates to their other skills.

Regardless, M365 dropping them would still be fairly trivial to work around, might not even affect their transactional emails, and probably makes it harder for law enforcement to prosecute them in the future.

"That's what I think. Acquisitions tend to run separately, at least for a while after acquisition. I know they're sharing some infra (eg some of the infra for Github Actions is shared with Azure Pipelines) but it's likely Github is still mostly separate from Microsoft.",1610985127,1
"Yeah that's my perception as well. Something happened and they themselves describe a ""pattern of behaviour"", we'll never know what that something was unless it goes to court and they have to explain it to a jury from scratch, and most likely they will settle. There are still plenty of open questions like:

* What did they use the internal slack for?
* Where did he say it in slack, a channel or a PM?
* Was it entirely off topic, i.e. did he say something about Nazis in a business channel?
* Were there other members of the team who had previously complained to HR?
* What was the pattern, was he previously warned not to make statements like this and did it anyways?
* Was there a fight going on between this guy and another person/people?
* Were they under threat of lawsuits from other employees? Calling someone a Nazi definitely falls under protected classes of race and this could be a reason.
* What were the internal HR policies on this, did HR comply with their own rules?
* Was the guy opposed to the company's HR policies and constantly fighting them or bringing politics into apolitical things? ([James Damore](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/lawsuit-goes-after-alleged-anti-conservative-bias-at-google/) comes to mind.)

If it is true that the *only* thing he did to justify firing was say ""watch out guys there are nazis about"" then holy crap Github is a terrible company to work for and everyone should stay away from it.

Somehow because this is a Microsoft subsidiary we're talking about and they promote a fun and [relaxed culture and diverse workplace](https://github.com/about/diversity) I kind of doubt that they are people who'd fire on the spot for saying anything slightly out of line.

"&gt;The one where you changed the whole structure of his argument by adding ‚Äúif‚Äù and ‚Äúchances are‚Äù.

Yeah because I don't know, none of us do. The only way we'll ever get to see what happened is if it gets filed in open court.

Also not OP, his argument isn't my argument. His part about ""HR will never tell you"" is correct, they don't. There's good reason for that, for one it makes them look bad, for another it does exactly what's happening now where the internet is critiquing HR decisions.

But above all it damages their brand and opens them up for lawsuits. If there's one thing that it's HR's job to do it's to prevent lawsuits.

&gt;Here‚Äôs an actual factual statement on the matter. IF you had any actual knowledge on the matter at hand CHANCES ARE one hundred percent you wouldn‚Äôt be posting here.

I do know for a fact that Microsoft has a social media policy and that things such as this are prohibited. It is 100% that if you had knowledge you would not be allowed to post outside the company without violating policy.

I can't do much other than quote the person who was fired and let you draw your own conclusions. We weren't there.

I can guarantee that given the tweets and the statement there was conflict between the HR team and the CEO. Especially given this quote it's clear to me that this post is primarily one aimed at damage control.

&gt;*Employees are free to express concerns about Nazis, antisemitism, white supremacy or any other form of discrimination or harassment in internal discussions. We expect all employees to be respectful, professional, and follow GitHub policies on discrimination and harassment.*

If it does go to open court and we find out what actually happened I'll follow up and post here, but until then this is all conjecture. I'm going to stick to what I know:

* Employee said ""stay safe homies, Nazis are about""
* Another employee found it offense and reported it to HR saying ""that type of rhetoric wasn‚Äôt good for work"" \[TechCrunch\]
* HR fired said individual for reasons
* A bunch of github employees wrote an internal memo objecting to the firing, which included at least 20% of all employees
* HR came back and said there was a ""*pattern of behavior* that is not conducive to company policy‚Äù as the rationale for his termination \[i.e. **More than one event = pattern**\]
* Employee says he said above because ""he was genuinely concerned about his co-workers in the area, in addition to his Jewish family members""
* Github hired an outside investigator on Jan 11
* On Jan 15 the investigation found ""significant errors of judgment and procedure."" \[Blog Post\]
* Head of HR resigns on Jan 16
* Tweets occur around this time.
* Github releases blog post emphasizing an apology but also using words like "" *It was appalling"",*  ""*GitHub condemns the attack""*

"&gt; maybe he was just really political at work?

&gt; this was the last straw

This is **exactly** why.

In any large corporation, there are going to be people of all different backgrounds and beliefs.

With any group of people with different backgrounds and beliefs, there is always potential for controversy, disagreements, arguments, fights, or worse -- all of which is toxic in the context of a work environment.

Having a ""professional demeanor"" requires keeping your thoughts and opinions to yourself on certain topics, very much including politics and events related to politics.

If someone has *multiple* write-ups for bringing up divisive topics at work, then there is justification to remove them if they continue to bring them up.  It is a demonstrated lack of professionalism, failure to abide by company culture guidelines, and failure to adhere to stipulations for an existing performance improvement plan (PIP).

There is no reason for a company to hold on to an employee that has had *multiple* complaints for bringing up political topics, and continues to do so after being told *repeatedly* to keep work conversations limited to work-related topics.  Especially in a company with the reputation of Microsoft/GitHub, where that position can be filled with another equally-qualified candidate within a matter of hours.

Really does *not* matter what the topic of conversation was, or what his thoughts / opinions / beliefs are.  He was unable to keep work conversations limited to work-related topics, despite multiple previous warnings.  His comments already managed to annoy enough other people to get him reported, and this most recent conversation about Nazis was the final straw for his company's leadership.  He had fair warnings about his behavior, and he chose to ignore them.

Instead of accepting the consequences for his own actions, he went ahead and twisted the narrative to frame it as if Microsoft/GitHub has a pro-Nazi stance, and he is a victim.  Then he decided to bring up his religious faith, as if that was even vaguely correlated to the events that transpired.  These are the actions of a narcissistic brat that is trying to manipulate public perception of Microsoft/GitHub so that he can avoid any repercussions that were imposed on him.  He went from being a problematic employee, to Chernobyl levels of toxicity.

He's probably going to get his job back, but modified.  Probably *zero* job responsibilities, and permanent work-from-home privileges.  Basically just pay him his salary to do literally nothing, then a year or two later dissolve his role and give him a fat severance package wrapped in a non-disparagement clause.

There aren't any actual political issues, here.  Microsoft/GitHub is not controlled by Nazis who want to destroy the livelihoods of Jews.  This is just one person making a spectacle of himself by taking advantage of a situation in order to get himself a lucrative settlement for claiming discrimination.",1610993246,-1

"&gt; My biggest complaint is the split between chats and channels. In Teams the chats and channels are on different tabs.

I'm not personally to fond of that design either. It's largely based on what the old Lync / SfB customers wanted. I complained a lot about it as well before I left Microsoft.

&gt; Also, if you need a join Teams from some other company (vendor or technical consultants) it works horribly.

I think Slack works better here too, although when Teams was launched Slack worked the same way as Teams. Unfortunately there's a lot of legal requirements that influenced that design. Some companies _need_ it set up that way for them to buy the product.

Once again it comes down to how Lync / SfB was designed. 

&gt; you don't get calendar notifications from the other 

That's a stupid Outlook legacy limitation, but until Lync / SfB is completely removed from the market they can't fix that. For Microsoft employees it was easy, because they just migrated all of us to something without legacy support; but customers can't do that as easily.

&gt; Stuff like missing people when searching, wrong names with correct avatars...

Meanwhile, people at the capitol were there for 1 goal, and nazis were there for the exact same goal. If you're finding yourself agreeing with nazis, you have a serious fucking issue. 

Looting doesn't require a political opinion at all, so your analogy is fucking embarrassing.

What evidence do you have that the looters were there for anything other than looting? We see the nazis there breaching capitol and holding signs that clearly demonstrate their cause.

How to limit reservable bandwidth to increase download speeds in Windows 10

Disclaimer: Editing the Windows Registry file is a serious undertaking. A corrupted Windows Registry file could render your computer inoperable, requiring a reinstallation of the Windows 10 operating system and potential loss of data. Back up the Windows 10 Registry file and create a valid restore point before you proceed. This disclaimer also applies to changes made with the Group Policy Editor.

How to use the Group Policy Editor

For users of Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise, the most effective way to change the default settings for reservable bandwidth is through the Group Policy Editor. Type ""group policy"" into the desktop search box and select the appropriate app (gpedit.msc) from the results. Navigate to this entry (Figure A) in the editor using the left-hand navigation bar:

Computer Configuration | Administrative Templates | Network | QoS Packet Scheduler

Figure A

Ôøº

In the right-hand pane, select the entry labeled Limit Reservable Bandwidth and double-click it to reveal the settings screen, as shown in Figure B.

Figure B

Ôøº

Click the Enabled button and change the default value of 80 to a smaller percentage or to zero if you prefer to turn it off. Note, clicking the Disabled button just changes it back to the default, so that will not work. Click Apply then OK to complete the process and then exit the editor.

How to use the Registry Editor

For users of Windows 10 Home, changing the default setting for reservable bandwidth requires an edit of the Windows Registry File. Type ""regedit"" into the desktop search box and select the appropriate item (regedit.msc) in the results. Using the left-hand windowpane, navigate to this specific key, as shown in Figure C:

Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Psched

Figure C

Ôøº

In the right-hand windowpane, select and then double-click the entry labeled: NonBestEffortLimit and click the decimal radio button, as shown in Figure D.

Figure D

Ôøº

Now, you can change the reservable bandwidth percentage to whatever setting you'd like. Again, choosing a setting of zero will disable the feature completely. Click OK to complete the process then exit Regedit.

An explanation and a warning

Keep in mind that Microsoft is not looking to reserve network bandwidth out of spite. This feature plays an integral part in Microsoft's Quality of Service (QoS) package. Zero-day security patches, for example, may need to use that bandwidth, regardless of the inconvenience it may cause, to keep your system safe from would-be malicious hackers.

"&gt; So, how is censoring sedition any different than censoring pedophilia?

The production of pedophilia content actively harms an innocent child who has no way of protecting themself.  The production of seditious content does not harm innocent people.  

&gt; Also, how is private organizations refusing to do business with unsavory individuals even remotely close to preventing freedom of speech?  

Taken by itself, as a concept, it's not.  And both people and private organizations have a strong and legitimate interest in being able to decide who they do and do not do business with and what sort of content they host on servers they operate.  
However when the public square, where national discourse takes place, is privately owned, 1st Amendment rights can't simply be waived off with 'it's not the government doing the censoring'.  
Right now we have a situation where if you piss off 6 liberal guys from California (Jeff Bezos/Amazon, Sundar Pichai/Google, Satya Nadella/Microsoft, Tim Cook/Apple, Mark Zuckerberg/Facebook, Jack Dorsey/Twitter) and they legitimately (within their rights) decide to stop doing business with you, you are effectively off the Internet.  If those 6 guys think you don't have a right to speak, you lose the biggest web hosts, easy access to Android phones, ALL access to Apple phones, and any access to the audiences on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, &amp; Instagram.

"On that note, you wanna know what the worst part was? At the time, I had recently figured out a way for our IT department to sift through all emails. We were using a Microsoft exchange email server and the IT department was basically run by high school kids. At that point in time, skimming through emails was not particularly frowned upon as it would be now, but basically there was some system update at some point in time where I realized we could query the entire company email and find whatever terms we wanted in whoevers inbox. I brought this info up at a stand-up meeting.

Within a week, a few members on who my team who didn't particularly care for me basically decided to use this new feature against me and sift through all of my emails. I got wind that the junior IT help desk dude was becoming an errand boy for our department head, and one of the programmers tipped me off that I was being outted by about 48 hours notice. They printed out a stack of these emails, sat me down in a room with HR and before she even said anything to me I said ""whatever is on those papers is misunderstood and with that I resign"".

That company was so sleezy. They used to ""refinance"" student loans by scamming fresh college graduates in to the option of having your loans consolidated (now all that shit is handled by sallie mae and nelnet or whatever). They employed ex-convicts in to management roles with nearly no experience in that field. They were funded by some family business that was suspected of money laundering. They would hire these scummy political speakers and activists to give motivational speeches for like $20,000 for one hour. They took boat trips out to international waters with underage people for who the fuck knows what, and kept pictures of inappropriate activities they do on these boat trips on the company servers. I knew this, and I believe because I knew too much they wanted me out (in hindsight they probably wanted to kill me).

The government effectively regulated this company our of business back in 2007, which is right around the time I decided to go back to school myself and change my life around for the better. For what it's worth, even though I'm moderately anonymous on the internet, it kinda scares me to type this all out knowing what I know now about how Epstein's shit went down. Who the fuck knows.

"They say you only truly die when the last person has spoken your name.

After this, you'll only truly die if Microsoft turns off your AI chatbot LOL",1611354245,1
"[1]

An AI chatbot that lets you interact with dead loved ones sounds like something straight out of science fiction. But if technology in a patent granted to Microsoft comes to fruition, interacting with a chatty 3D digital version of the deceased could one day become de rigueur. 

The patent, titled ""Creating a conversational chatbot of a specific chatbot of a specific person,"" details a system that would access images, voice data, social media posts, electronic messages and the like to ""create or modify a special index in the theme of the specific person's personality."" In some cases, images and video could be used to create a 3D model of the person for extra realism. 

It's an especially provocative notion when you consider the patent's suggestion that the tech ""may correspond to a past or present entity."" 

The patent lists Dustin Abramson and Joseph Johnson, Jr. as inventors. Microsoft filed the patent in 2017, but it was granted this month and has become the subject of online chatter in the past few days due to its suggestion of a chatbot that brings a ""past entity"" back to life as a kind of interactive living memorial. As jarring as the idea might seem at first, many who've lost a loved one will understand the comfort that can come from watching old videos of the deceased, or listening to their archived voicemails. Death creates an aching hole we long to fill. 

Still, Tim O'Brien, general manager of AI programs at Microsoft, confirmed on Twitter on Friday that ""there's no plan for this. 

""But if I ever get a job writing for Black Mirror,"" he wrote, ""I'll know to go to the USPTO website for story ideas.""

The British sci-fi series explored a similar concept of resurrecting the dead through technology in the moving 2013 episode Be Right Back. In it, a bereaved woman played by Hayley Atwell hires a service that lets her interact with a shockingly accurate AI re-creation of her dead boyfriend, played by Domhnall Gleeson. This version is based on his past online communication and social media profiles.

Similar scenarios have already made their way into real life, with holograms of celebrities like Whitney Houston and rapper Tupac Shakur. And in 2015, Eugenia Kuyda, co-founder and CEO of software company Replika, trained a chatbot on thousands of text messages she'd shared with her best friend Roman, who died in a car accident. In doing so, she created an immortal digital Roman that could still ""talk"" to family and friends.",1611354307,1
"[2]

That a company as prominent as Microsoft has outlined a system for immortalizing the dead through chatbots suggests the practice could someday become far more widely accepted and used. But as my CNET colleague Alison DeNisco Rayome explores in this story, the question is should we do it? And if we do, what should it look like? As the Black Mirror episode highlights, there are no easy answers.",1611354317,-1

The availability of substitutes doesn't change anything.  

&gt; they absolutely do. either by taking more than they said they are, or obfuscating what you have agreed to. They've only been dragged into improved transparency

Simply not true. Amongst people who pay attention to privacy matters Google is known as the best of the big boys.  Yes their privacy policies are inferior to a few of the small guys (Firefox, Duckduckgo, etc) but they've always been better than all the other big players (Apple is roughly the same). 

In one place, Google will show you all the info that have on you and let you delete anything you aren't comfortable with.  In that same place, you can see everything they collect an can opt out of collection of any of it.

For now.  Google still exists too. This law hasn't been passed.  And right now it's written to **only** impact Google (by name) and Facebook.  That should be a red flag.  But if all search engines get forced to pay for links, they will all close up shop an leave too.

You are making a ridiculous assertion that most people do not agree with (especially outside of Europe).  Yet rather than defend it when questioned, you pretend it is a sacred cow that cannot even be questioned. 


**Here's the bottom line:** Google makes money by connecting people looking for content to content: not on the content itself.  This has been amazing for smaller publishers a they are finally able to make a living competing with the bigger publishers.  

Obviously, bigger publishers have seen their share of the pie decrease and hate Google quite a bit. This is why media coverage of Google is so one-sided.

You can also see that while the malware uses domains mostly with a .ru TLD they also use Australia's TLD, so does that mean the Australians are working with Putin?

A DNS request to a .ru TLD does not necessarily mean you will be directed to an IP address located in Russia. Often people use .ru TLDs because they are not as well regulated and abuse reports aren't dealt with as quickly.

"""Bundled"" = it came with the system and was built within the system in a way for the system to favor it over other browsers which would run much slower (anyone who used Netscape back then know what I'm talking about).

That's probably the lone difference between Apple's walled garden and Microsoft, that they don't likely overtly do anything to make other browser apps run slower, or whatnot. Microsoft didn't sell their own computers back then, so there was never the ""you force your OS onto your own machines"" bit that Apple does, but I think that would be arguably justified for a company to do.

That said, I do think a lot of their practices within iOS and the app store should be considered anti-competitive.

It's also counterproductive to donate to people who want to overthrow the system where you have any voice at all in the political process. That is, unless they believe their money will always guarantee them a seat at the table in political discussions relevant to their industry. But that seems like a huge risk, to which business is usually adverse. It seems like a huge risk to assume that their business would be considered a good guy insider if the insurrection had been a success and that they wouldn't just be used as a political scapegoat.

"To answer your edit....

There are basically two positions you can take on any security (stock): Long or Short.  Most regular folk are really only familiar with going Long - that is, I have a 1000 dollars that I spend on buying Microsoft stock.  When you buy a stock and hold it with hopes of the price increasing and (possibly) receiving dividend payments, you are Long on the stock.

A riskier but equally valid play is going Short. That means betting against the stock because you think the share price will drop substantially in the near future. So how do you do this?  You ask someone who is Long to temporarily borrow their shares (no different than  borrowing money - Shorts have to pay an interest rate to the Long who they are borrowing from). You then sell those borrowed shares at the current market price with the hopes of buying it back later at a lower price and pocketing the difference.

Example: You are Long on Microsoft and own 10 shares at $100 per share. I think $100 is too high and that its true price is $30.  I ask you to borrow your shares  temporarily so that I can sell them at the current price.  I agree to pay you 7% interest while borrowing your shares.

I then Short them.  If I'm right and Microsoft drops to $30, I will buy them back at 30 and then give them back to you (plus the interest I owe).  BUT.....if I'm wrong and Microsoft goes to $200.....I still owe you the shares! That means I have to buy them back at 200 and then give them back to you (plus the interest I owe you).

" Top 10 most significant Microsoft future technology

 

**Let‚Äôs Look at**[most significant Microsoft future technology.](https://infortechbizz.com/most-significant-microsoft-future-technology/)**Do you know about the most significant hardware business at Microsoft? Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella asked last week during a media conference? ‚ÄúXbox,‚Äù replied a reporter who had requested Nadella how computer hardware products like Surface and Xbox fit Microsoft‚Äôs broader aspirations. ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs our cloud,‚Äù Nadella dismisses. He explains how Microsoft builds everything from data centers to servers and a**[network](https://infortechbizz.com/most-significant-microsoft-future-technology/) **stack that fits internally.**

[As the journalist progressed on the hardware side](https://infortechbizz.com/most-significant-microsoft-future-technology/)**, a question often posed by Microsoft‚Äôs focus on the cloud. Nadella gave us an excellent view of today‚Äôs Microsoft. That goes beyond billions of Windows users or predecessors in the company.**

"If you consider today's wages in terms of representing buying power, so lifetime wages would be lifetime buying power inflation is somewhat included. For napkin math we can just say inflation is normalized by buying power.

$20k ie roughly poverty level $1M ($10/hour \* 50 weeks\* 40hrs/week=$20K)

$35k ie roughly median US income $1.75M

Remember how much trouble Google, Apple, and Microsoft were when Trump imposed travel bans on Middle Eastern countries? He actually attacked the majority of their labor force. We don't have very many actual, home grown Americans capable of doing this work.

In 2025 5 of the top 10 global retailers will be Chinese, all of them based on digital markets. They‚Äôve innovated dramatically in the space, including logistics, data, and ecosystem building and have basically shortcut the need for physical retail in the country because they adopted e-commerce early and have grown significantly. China is also a leader in manufacturing of green tech, EV research, and is building world class transport systems. 

I did study abroad in China and while they may have a comparative lack of higher ed by per capita basis, they do have several great research institutions. Just due to their sheer scale and size of economy they are going be able to innovate more than somewhere like Switzerland.

"Full disclaimer I'm not impacting by this and the software as it stands isn't completely open source. 

But what you're implying is not what they did or rather just did. They added the repo and added Microsoft GPG key so they can run anything on the system. 

They did this in relative secrecy with a script without informing anybody. They then shut down all discussion on the forum with comments like that this was just Microsoft bashing. 

That is why trust has been broken. 

At the moment the added repo only includes software related to VS Code but we don't know if they could change. Users were never informed about this change do we presume to automatically told if there are further changes? Does a user need to check before every update.

What if a user trys to update or install an app and the microsoft repo says it's in here? They have added the ability for microsoft to do this and run anything on the system. If they decided to push something with some telemetry many users wouldn't know, even an advanced user would be forgiven for not immediately noticing. 

You may say Microsoft aren't going to do they (ignoring the times they have done the same in Windows) but lets say this wasn't Microsoft. If this has been a Russian or Chinese software company, suddenly handed the keys to run and install what ever they would want, would more people be able to see the issue of trust this presents? 

Further more it now means a user is pinging a microsoft server every update. This gives them information. On it's own it's you have a pi, this IP address, perhaps some information on app installed and build configuration. It doesn't sound like much but collectively with other data points it can compound into something more insidious. 

We are now getting to a time where people outside netsec, data and analytic processing and security are starting to take issue with online tracking and telemetry as more and more information about the scary capabilities of current methods become public knowledge. 

Again this is why trust has been broken. At a time that many people, especially in this community, are trying to cut down on their online footprint, they go and perform this change and shut down forum discussion on this. 

If an option, say the same script, was added to the normal repos and not forced installed this would not be an issue. A user who wanted to make this change quickly could just download and execute the script when they wanted VSCode. 

They however did not do this. They forced installed it on every device. Despite that many lack GUI's. Many are acting as servers. Many users prefer to use VSCodium. Many won't use VSCode at all. So why force such an extreme change to all users. 

Furthermore on the fix you have suggested. They have already edited your source files before. What if next update they decide to repush this change? You also need to delete the GPG key and then block it from doing so again because trust has been violated. 

Now for me not a problem. I don't use that OS, I would use anther distro or if I needed to use the OS I can get a build without these changes. And ""fixing"" these changes and stopping them from happening again is also easy. But that's because I'm fairly technical and have been using linux hobby and professionally for a long time and I'm sure for many of the people angry at this the same is true. 

But for beginners this is intimidating. You can say they as beginners they shouldn't be worried about this but they have a right to be worried about what ever they are worried about. This is a secretive and trust shattering change from a beginner and hobby project distro. So again this is why people are angry.",1612797266,1

Why didn't they inform their userbase before this change was made?
 
Why did they then shut down all discussion on their forums on this issue? 

Why not also provide a script in the repo that reveres these changes? 

You talk about ease of user but this has created more work needed to maintain the OS. I've used many different distros over the years non have added a repo behind my back which I then must manually remove. 

If you want ease of use, why not make the process of adding repos and installing GPG keys more streamlined. That would logically improve the OS ease of use. This change helps one piece of software but there are still many others which will still require manually adding GPG keys and repos.

Ok. But nobody really uses freecad. The industry that uses cad uses autocad. Thats what the engineers are trained on. Thats whats used. Now while you will suggest to use ""FreeCAD"" as replacement. Now you just need to re-train all your cad users for your company. That cost well exceeds the licensing costs of the cad + os system. What decision is the company going to make?

Same deal with office. Yup open office is great. Until you need to work with somebody else in a commercial setting. Then your screwed. The office 365 stuff makes this way more practicle these days since it runs in a browser but ultimatly this is the solution because Microsoft won't ship it for Linux.

Both openoffice and things like freecad are greate until something not supported the same way doesn't get imported correctly. Its even worse when its a silent corruption and goes unnoticed.....

Same deal with games. Look at the effort steam has be going though trying to get wine to work to enable people to ship games on Linux and its complete hit and miss. Games vendors are ""great"" at porting things to other platforms as well you know like Platstation, Xbox, PC but not Linux because or low demand and technical problems makes it non cost effective to do.

Some of the application I have seen ported which have since been dropped from Linux had really bad problems running.

Look at apps like. Spotify, Slack, Discord, Teams and a bunch of others things which all are based on electron which is basically ship a jail (browser) so you can run your app on multiple platforms.

Also have a think about the hardware problems like printers, scanners and various other USB devices.

We don't if it was so easy people would do it and they don't. What your not seeing here is that a QA process and support for ""shipped software"" by a company isn't quite the same as open source software.

Even free software like spotify, slack, chrome and all sorts of things when they ship it screw it up because there isn't any guide lines.

Maybe I think my company should work on that stuff so we get a say as opposed to some more typical defense contractor. Point is - a union should be, ya know, united, right? What can we all agree on? Pay, benefits, work life balance. I dunno about much else I can agree with essentially all my coworkers about. 

Again, parental leave at these places is best in the country. I understand that it's even more generous in some other places... but our pay is much higher than those places.

If you had to pick one group, you couldn't decide? Tech workers have relatively little to gain from this. I see a lot of calls for tech workers to unionize, but... retail? Food service? EMS? Nurses?

"I live in a small rural area of NW Oklahoma. Nearest ""city"" is a good hour or so drive.

A handful or so businesses I've assisted over the years, rely on their ATT (or other ISP) provided email, not just gmail. I've had the luxury of assisting regain access to email accounts, with somewhere about 50% or less being unsuccessful.

First issues is, ""merging accounts"". I'm looking at you ATT. Had a client using SBCGlobal, lose a heavily used email account, and lost the email address when working with ATT over the phone. By lost, I mean deleted, and ATT (actually yahoo), does not recover email addresses. Once deleted, no one can obtain the email address, not even the original owner. Client has a local copy of all emails, but he had said email on all his business cards, and other advertisements.

The second issue, lack of setting up, and kept updated, recovery settings. Always setup a recovery secondary email on the account. If you chose not use your birthdate, keep that documented, along with the security questions and answers. If you setup 2FA, if it's an option, save a copy of those one time codes, Seriously!

Third, 2FA is your friend. Not just ""here's 6 numbers for one minute"", the popup and/or email approval is good. The one minute changing pin is still the best. Receiving a one time code via SMS/Text is HIGHLY not recommended, and should be avoided. It's clear text, not encrypted, and apps on your phone could see said code when you receive it. Revieve it by email or a call, if you can't run a 2FA app on your phone. Apps that notify you, like Google and Facebook, is just as good, when signing into said accounts on another device. Microsoft has similar with their 2FA app.

Lastly, I agree, if you are running a business, get an email account with a domain you own. Gmail does have that option, as does MS's O365, but having your email hosted on a third party that will not cut you out of the blue is best. I like Proton Mail as a personal, no clue for business. Just make sure said email is hosted on a non-cheap and with good security and filtering.

Yeah, it'd cost per email address, aliasing and distribution groups are free (at least from what I have seen with managed email accounts). But when you need help, tech support is there.",1612819038,1

"Coming from 3rd parties isn't the issue. [Microsoft only distributes drivers that it has certified.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/develop/signing-a-driver-for-public-release) And you can always download drivers and install them independently.

The issue here is that when you run your 'check for updates' command. It goes to Microsoft's package server for a list of the packages it maintains.

Linux requires password clearance to use elevated privileges, Windows doesn't et cetera. Basically Windows is much, much more open in terms of allowing malware attack based on social engineering than Linux.

I don't know what that has to do with anything. According to the parent comment if people can see the code they should be able to find vulnerabilities easy and the whole system is less secure. 

If anything you're proving my point that Windows being closed source does not make it more secure. 

I do agree the software distribution of Windows is insecure and sucks. So does Microsoft. The Windows Store is their attempt to fix that.

Most android ""malware"" does nothing nefarious on a system level. If you install some bullshit app and give it access to all your data then there's nothing the operating system can do to stop you.

Janke, whose firm has incubated startups with former members of the U.S. intelligence community, said the two companies are not allowed to speak publicly about that work but they did share details from their analysis with him. He agreed to discuss their findings generally to raise awareness about the threat of Chinese espionage within technology supply chains.

**Mike Quinn**, a cybersecurity executive who served in senior roles at Cisco Systems Inc. and Microsoft Corp., said he was briefed about added chips on Supermicro motherboards by officials from the U.S. Air Force. Quinn was working for a company that was a potential bidder for Air Force contracts, and the officials wanted to ensure that any work would not include Supermicro equipment, he said. Bloomberg agreed not to specify when Quinn received the briefing or identify the company he was working for at the time.
‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt a case of a guy stealing a board and soldering a chip on in his hotel room; it was architected onto the final device,‚Äù Quinn said, recalling details provided by Air Force officials. The chip ‚Äúwas blended into the trace on a multilayered board,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúThe attackers knew how that board was designed so it would pass‚Äù quality assurance tests, Quinn said.

He emphasized that the information was shared in an unclassified setting. ‚ÄúThe FBI knew the activity was being conducted by China, knew it was concerning, and alerted certain entities about it.‚Äù

Ward has more than 40,000 followers for his conspiracy theory videos. It is unclear whether he gets a share of ad revenue from YouTube.

In one video, which carried adverts for Grammarly and Big Yellow Box storage, Ward claims that the vaccine is causing mass deaths and was created by Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, to reduce the world‚Äôs population.

‚ÄúI knew they were going to shut down the world‚Äôs economy for a global financial reset,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI knew they were going to use the virus, the vaccine, the 5G, the riots and the alien invasion as a smokescreen. I knew that.‚Äù

He says that people should resist the vaccine, even if it becomes necessary for travel. ‚ÄúI go to Africa a lot,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had an injection going to Africa . . . never. Because I pay $100 not to, because the Africans are good boys. I say I want the certificate . . . straight through.‚Äù

He goes on to claim that doctors and nurses who have treated coronavirus patients or administered vaccines will one day be ‚Äúheld responsible‚Äù for genocide.

In the first 24 hours that the video was live on YouTube, it gained more than 13,000 views. He has over 40,000 subscribers on the site with more than 1 million total views.

Companies do not have control over the videos their advertisements are placed next to, although YouTube has a policy not to put advertising next to dangerous or derogatory content, including antivax and QAnon material.

A spokesman for Big Yellow Box said: ‚ÄúWe are very disappointed to learn about this. We were not aware of it and it should not have happened given the safety measures in place for this form of advertising. We have suspended our advertising on YouTube with immediate effect until this is resolved.‚Äù

As well as running adverts alongside antivax content, The Times found examples of misinformation on other sites being promoted through paid advertisements on YouTube.

&gt;MICROSOFT has held talks with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp over a possible plan for the software giant to pay the media company to remove its news websites from Google, a report said today.

&gt;Mr Murdoch has prompted a fierce debate among media watchers with his accusation that Google is ""stealing"" from his vast newspaper empire and his threat to block the search engine from accessing its content.

&gt;Rupert Murdoch accused [Google] of ‚Äústealing stories‚Äù by posting links and short article excerpts on its search engine. Now, he appears ready to strike, by pulling his company‚Äôs news articles from Google and putting them on Microsoft search engines instead.

&gt;In order for Murdoch's plan to succeed, a critical mass of larger news publishers will need to join this effort, as Microsoft is apparently asking them to do. Although highly unlikely, Google could join Microsoft in paying for the right to list these ""premium"" news articles if not doing so means losing access to a large chunk of current events.

&gt;More likely, Google will refuse to pay and news consumers will prefer to access whatever news Google offers for free rather than switching to Microsoft's Bing search engine to see whatever articles Microsoft paid to index.

"&gt; Wine - is that still a thing?

Not only is it still a thing, they're already on version 6.

Steam (Valve) has put in ridiculous amounts of work and time improving the Wine system and have their own flavour of it called Proton. It's actually baked into the Linux version of Steam where you can now install and play Windows games on the Linux version of Steam with one-click. The only major thing that still needs to be resolved is anti-cheat software. Currently if a game uses anti-cheat (many competitive multiplayer games) will technically work, but you get booted by the anti-cheat detecting something is off.

But games like Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition (a recent multiplayer and competitive Microsoft game) work beautifully on Linux.

And this month the Linux 5.11 kernel is being released that has a lot of groundwork in place to enable a lot of things needed for even better compatibility with Windows applications. There's still a lot of work that needs to be done on the non-kernel side of things, like in Wine, but the groundwork is there now. So big improvements will be coming.

Check out [PortonDB](https://protondb.com/) for a community list of games that work on Linux.

&gt; If you're already looking into Linux, you know what you're getting into, and you know how to deal with the potential problems.

This is true, but it doesn't mean that someone inexperienced getting into Linux will have a hard time at all. I've setup many people with Linux who are just average users and they manage just fine. You do not need to touch the command line as many (misinformed) people tend to claim. The REASON many guides online post command line instructions is because the terminal is the most common denominator across all Linux systems. There are many distros out there and fair number of different GUIs, so it's easiest to post the single terminal command instead of multiple pictures for where to click, which might not even be the same for all users.

A new user should ***not*** go with an Arch based system. Going with Ubuntu or Pop!_OS (yes that's how it's spelled) is best. A new user can find their way around as the UI is very intuitive (arguably more so than Windows. Honestly the Windows 10 start menu is such a mess now).",1613246475,1

"Just a few primer-level topics:

[Public Good (the economic concept)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics))

[Market structures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_structure)

Steam is actually a marketplace provider more than an actual monopoly itself, the same as a nascent NYSE. Steam isn‚Äôt necessarily beneficial of its own accord, although many monopolies are good in many ways in their adolescence; Steam is basically at the whim of the firms (game designers) who provide their products on the marketplace, and Steam make a consistent endeavor to remain a favorable marketplace for the community by appealing to both the firms and the users because there are consistently other sharks circling (Amazon, Google, Microsoft) who are more capable of filling Steam‚Äôs place in the market if the game publishers decide to move elsewhere.

If you view steam as a provider firm rather than a simple marketplace, then it can be said that Steam has all of the market-optimization obligations of a firm in competition because other firms have alreafy surmounted the barriers to entry in the market and begun making use of the economies of scale available due to their work in adjacent markets (general software distribution), and all of the provider-satisfaction obligations of a buyer with a tentative [monopsony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopsony) that‚Äôs living on a knife‚Äôs edge.",1613285124,1

"i think you're missing the whole point of apples principle. they're a hardware company first, and the most important element to sell hardware is user experience.

you're right, they don't care about privacy. but what they do care about, adamantly so, is user experience. but in most cases, user experience and privacy are one and the same. so it's pretty basic as to why, as they're not stupid, of course they'll market it for the sake of privacy and security when it's in-built into the user experience and differentiates them versus their competition.

apple technology is not always, but usually, localized on your device. and in those cases it means there is no data being collected/used. a good example of this would be apple's face id, which, unlike google and microsoft, relies entirely on a localized chip to work. no connection necessary. no data uploaded or downloaded. it can be used offline. this is a great user experience.

apple also rely on strong security for their products simply because it makes the phone less interesting to steal (again, user experience). if you steal an iphone you will quickly discover that you can't use most of the parts nor can you ever use the actual phone itself, because it is permanently locked to the hardware id of the phone and the user who used it. effectively, you've got a brick that you can't sell to the black market, phone repair shops, or use by yourself.

but, yes. in the cases where user experience is enhanced by an online cloud service system (i.e. icloud backup api, pages, etc). your are leaking data, but that data leak is entirely tied into your user experience. i.e. you can have live collaboration in pages. and icloud backups creates a seamless sync between your apple devices, backups and operation. they also point out that they have the encryption key, which again, is for user experience (they can unlock your data for you if you forget your password). this however does not mean they are harvesting your data and building analytical profiles of you to use in any malicious way like facebook, microsoft and google does. mostly because they aren't harvesting any useful data, your icloud data is mainly third party data and not apple data.

"It seems people are confused how this attack takes place and the linked article doesn't offer much clarity. [This whitepaper from Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/mediahandler/files/resourcefiles/3-ways-to-mitigate-risk-using-private-package-feeds/3%20Ways%20to%20Mitigate%20Risk%20When%20Using%20Private%20Package%20Feeds%20-%20v1.0.pdf) released following this issue does a better job.

Many developers rely on open-source libraries. No need to write everything from scratch when someone did it better for free. In large corporations this is usually a layered process, with external and internal packages. Internal packages are reusable code within the organisation, to standardise and speed up repeat tasks like connecting to a centralised login system.

Unfortunately, packages with the same name can exist both in the external and internal package index. It turns out that, if you can guess the name of an internal package, you can make an open source one on the external package index and add whatever code you want. If everthing's set up incorrectly (probably the default settings), then the software will use the latest version available. That way you can get them to download your code instead of their own.

When they downloaded the code, it will run and the build will fail. It's highly unlikely that you manage to mimic the internal package's functionality without prior knowledge, which kinda beats the point of needing access. Either way, as Microsoft says it:

&gt;Even though your build failed, the attacker still achieved remote code execution.

So, bad stuff happens. What are possible solutions?

1. If your package manager doesn't allow controlled scopes, only download internal packages. Unfortunately, it means duplicating external packages to your own package index first.
2. Some package managers allow you to scope packages, avoiding name confusion. All involved code will need to be updated for the new naming conventions, so that's a pain.
3. Make sure to verify packages client-side. Use the specific version (3.1.2 instead of &gt;=3.1) or other solutions available in your package manager of choice (see whitepaper).

I don't have hands-on experience with internal package indices, so I may've gotten some things wrong.",1613310489,-1

"That amount of data is not going to be uncommon going forward. The median amount of data for a family was 500gb/month. But now that many jobs are going remote and a lot of schooling is going remote your going to see that number soar. 


Let‚Äôs say that average family using 500gbs goes remote:

1. Microsoft teams uses about 2.7gb/hr for a video call. So if your job has about 3 hours of video calls per day that‚Äôs about 3hours X 2.7gb = 8.1gb/day x 20 working days a month = 162gb per month per person. So in a family of two working adults that‚Äôs 324gb. 
2. VOIP uses between .5mb/minute to 1.3mb/minute. Let‚Äôs assume the middle number of .9mb/minute. Let‚Äôs assume 2 hours of calls per day. 120 minutes x .9mb = 108mb/day. 108mb x 20 days = 2gb. Two working adults is 4gb a month
3. Outlooks uses about 450mb to download 40mb of data on average (it‚Äôs on in the background). So let‚Äôs assume 2gb per day. Or 40 per month per person or 80 total. 
4. Regular work internet surface is probably a minimum of another 2gb. So another 80 per month. 
5. Cell phone wifi. A lot of people would use their office wifi or just cellular data while at work. Now there going to be tapped on to the wifi. 
6. Children going to school. Video for 6 hours per day at 2.7 is 16.2gb per day or 324gb per month.

This all started because of an article written by Kotaku claiming people's PS5 controllers were suffering from stick drift. The authors source for this was a few posts on the PS5 subreddit and a few dozen tweets.

The article was noticed by this law firm that was already suing Microsoft and Nintendo over stick drift so they decided they might as well go after Sony too so they told people to contact them and this person did.

It is pretty easy to get them to replace it, just tell them you did the checks they requested.

And there have been over 5 millions of these things sold. All hardware has a failure rate so even if the failure rate was as low as 0.5% that would still be 25 000 people with faulty controllers.",1613613371,-1

"Gates has none of the inside knowledge that the people there are dealing with.  The only reason he is getting attention is because of his wealth and former dealings with Microsoft.  All the sudden he is the most knowledgeable person on Covid vaccines and now power generation and distribution for the state of Texas?  Wind generation isnt the answer.  On the east, wind typically slows down or stops in cold temps and only increases with temp swings.  Nuclear generation is clean energy, no one is addressing that.    If Texas had a zillion windmill farms the odds are they would be down now also because of lack of prep from them never seeing weather like this and likely would have no infrastructure to deal with it.  Ice coated blades, frozen cooling systems, hazards of maintenance in situations like this are some things they would experience for the first time.

It‚Äôs almost as if he has been politicized and most people don‚Äôt actually look into what he does / has done in the past.


I mean, this is a man that has donated nearly $50 BILLION of his wealth over the past 20 years (with plans to donate almost all of his wealth when he dies), actively encourages other billionaires to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes, and has dedicated him post-Microsoft life to tackling some of the biggest issues facing humanity across the globe - he‚Äôs an incredibly smart and ambitious man, who‚Äôs arguably done more good for humanity than almost any other individual...and when he‚Äôs brought up nowadays, it seems like half the responses are screaming ‚ÄòHe wants to inject microchips in babies to take over the world!!1!1!‚Äô...

Bill Gates, famous for creating Microsoft is not an expert on green energy, nor is he an expert on Texas economics, he‚Äôs simply a man with a purpose to say and do things that suit his interests.

You may be an expert, but if you have no open source code to show and no industry certifications, why should **I** believe you are an expert and trust your opinion?

But why do they see him as an expert?  How has he proved that expertise?  Throwing money around is not a qualification.  

&gt;And even if you don't think he is an ""expert"", does that mean he has no knowledge? 

I am not saying he has no knowledge.  He has not proven he has knowledge. 

&gt;Does that mean he is wrong? 

Possibly. Yes.  I have no reason to believe he is correct.  


&gt;I could tell you what he does about the private jet, and why, but it seems you will spin it negatively. 

Yes, he fuels it with biofuel.  But he could also travel commercially and pay for his flight to be bio fueled.   It's the **private** part of his choice of air travel that is so damaging.  And then he invests to enable other rich people to be equally wasteful.  

&gt;You say you don't hate Bill, but everything you say is negative towards him.

I'm agnostic about his claimed knowledge.  The fact that 2/3 of his wealth is still private shows that his philanthropy is mostly a tax smokescreen.   

&gt;Do some research on his private jet 

My argument is against him making private flights more available for other rich people.  How many times do I have to highlight the word **private**.

\^The post we are commenting on is literally about Bill Gates who has no science or medical background but is highlighted speaking on topics of those areas. Is he right about this subject, yes but that is what devils do they tell the truth half the time. Also 2016 was actually the warmest year on record since they have been keeping records since only the last 141 years. Has the Earth got warmer in the last decade, slightly yes of course but warming is not the disease industries that cause massive co2 emissions which cause the temp to rise globally is the disease, and then people like Gates polluting the Earth and making things worse by geoengineering as if that's the solution like putting a fucking bandage on the ozone is wise. Gates is heavily invested in geoengineering that is not a Conspiracy its a fact you can look it up. Also the Gulf Stream would be sped up not slowed by raised heat, ocean currents are sped up by heat so wtf are you really saying about science!? Also Gates company Microsoft claims to be carbon neutral (hilarious) and that they will be carbon negative by 2030 when -- 

""Meanwhile, increasing the scrutiny on Microsoft‚Äôs plan are its dealings  with fossil fuel companies, which have been highlighted by some as  evidence of hypocrisy as it makes climate pledges. In 2019 alone, the  technology company had entered into long-term partnerships with three  major oil companies, including ExxonMobil, that will be using  Microsoft‚Äôs technology to expand oil production by as much as 50,000  barrels a day over the coming years. The staggering amount of carbon  this would release into the atmosphere would not be included on  Microsoft‚Äôs expanded carbon ledger.""  


Lets not forget their plans to go carbon negative don't involve cutting co2 but using giant co2 sucking machines that will suck the co2 Microsoft emits then inject it into rock formations underground. Yeah that does not sound dangerous at all, smells like Earthquakes and other unknown environmental side effects to the Earth/Soil/Crust. Also these machines require HUGE amounts of land -  


""The second concern is that the transition from coal to biofuel would require setting aside vast tracts of arable land ‚Äì some [estimates](https://www.fern.org/fileadmin/uploads/fern/Documents/Fern%20BECCS%20briefing_0.pdf)  say one to two times the size of India. According to climate campaigner  Perlman this would mean that the energy industry would probably have to  compete with food production in a world where 10 billion people will  need to be fed, while vastly enlarging industrialized plantations and  reducing biodiversity.""  


How about we have trees that capture co2 naturally and we don't need to cut down any more forests but build so you don't have to in balance with the environment. Also switch to fuels that do not emit co2! We could be wayy ahead on this as a Planet by now but nope. You know how much land Microsoft is behind clearing as far as forests and trees by being pioneers in PC's and just messing it up overall? Tech in bad hands is just not good and we can't stay sleep to this. This is why they are called snakes, they play both sides (forked-tongue) to fool and manipulate. They cause the problem than present the solution (which really is not the solution and causes MORE problems) just like Gates did by creating the first Computer virus. -   


""While working with the Computer Center's PDP-10, Gates was responsible  for what was probably the first computer virus, a program that copies  itself into other programs and ruins data. Discovering that the machine  was connected to a national network of computers called Cybernet, Gates  invaded the network and installed a program on the main computer that  sent itself to the rest of the network's computers and crashed. When  Gates was found out, he was severely reprimanded, and he kept away from computers for his entire junior year at Lakeside.""

Google fired the lead of its Ethical Artificial Intelligence team, Meg Mitchell, escalating the turmoil surrounding its AI division after the acrimonious exit of Mitchell‚Äôs former colleague Timnit Gebru.

In the aftermath of Friday‚Äôs firing, Google‚Äôs head of AI, Jeff Dean, tried to repair relations with the company‚Äôs staff, saying at an all-hands meeting that he took ‚Äúsome responsibility‚Äù for the break in trust with researchers.

‚ÄúI take some amount of responsibility and I¬†feel¬†like other leads in the organization also take responsibility,‚Äù Dean said during the meeting. ‚ÄúWe know that the ethical AI team¬†feels¬†sort of aggrieved by the decision to ask some members of that team to retract the paper and other subsequent events.‚Äù

Earlier, Mitchell¬†tweeted¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôm fired,‚Äù adding she was ‚Äúin too much pain to articulate much of anything useful. Firing @timnitGebru created a domino effect of trauma for me and the rest of the team, and I believe we are being increasingly punished for that trauma.‚Äù

Mitchell‚Äôs firing highlighted that even as Google tried to move past the disarray in its AI division with an apology, a leadership change and new policies, the upheaval showed no sign of letting up.

Mitchell had become a fierce public critic of Google and its management after Gebru‚Äôs exit. Gebru, one of the few prominent Black women in AI research, said she was fired in December after refusing to retract a research paper critical of a key Google technology or remove the Google authors from it. The company has said that she resigned. Mitchell was a co-author of the paper. Former colleagues expressed outrage over Google‚Äôs handling of the matter.
The¬†Alphabet Inc.¬†company had accused Mitchell of downloading files from its systems and said it would review her conduct. For five weeks, Mitchell, who had co-led the Ethical AI team with Gebru, was locked out of all corporate systems -- unable to access her email or calendar.
‚ÄúAfter conducting a review of this manager‚Äôs conduct, we confirmed that there were multiple violations of our code of conduct, as well as of our security policies, which included the exfiltration of confidential business-sensitive documents and private data of other employees,‚Äù a Google spokesman said in a statement.

Mitchell‚Äôs dismissal came the same day that Dean apologized in an email to staff for how he¬†handled¬†Gebru‚Äôs departure and pledged that executives would be graded on diversity progress. Dean also said Google would double its human resources staff dedicated to employee retention.
Alex Hanna, a researcher on Google‚Äôs Ethical AI team, wrote that there‚Äôs a double standard for conduct at the internet giant, alluding to allegations of sexual misconduct against former executives.
‚ÄúGoogle is a breeding ground to abusers, opportunity hoarders, and people only concerned with ego and prestige,‚Äù Hanna wrote on Twitter. ‚ÄúBut anyone who is willing to defend friends against discrimination, who lift up voices who need to be heard, are shown the door.‚Äù

Dean, in his email to staff, said Google‚Äôs behavior toward Gebru hurt some female and Black employees and led them to question whether they belonged at the company, but he didn‚Äôt apologize directly to Gebru. The company announced a new organization for the responsible use of AI on Thursday, led by Marian Croak, a respected Black executive who had previously handled site reliability. But some members of the Ethical AI team, who will report to Croak,¬†felt¬†blindsided by the news.
Later, at the staff meeting, Dean said wasn‚Äôt seeking to ‚Äúpunish anyone‚Äù by orchestrating the reorganization of the company‚Äôs responsible AI efforts.

Mitchell joined Google in November 2016 after a stint at Microsoft Corp.‚Äôs research lab where she worked on the company‚Äôs Seeing AI project, a technology to help blind users ‚Äúvisualize‚Äù the world around them that was heavily promoted by Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella. At Google, she founded the Ethical AI team in 2017 and worked on projects including a way to explain what machine-learning models do and their limitations, and how to make machine-learning datasets more accountable and transparent.",1613786566,1

"&gt; should companies like Google even be allowed to have this kind of power? 

This is why things are going to be so interesting over the next decade+.     IMO, the Internet broke capitalism.

I became involved with the Internet in 1986.    I started with Bitnet in 1985 and switched over.

Me and most people thought the Internet was going to empower the little guy.    I use to do a lot of presenting on the Internet around the globe in the early days.

We constantly talked about how the Internet leveled the playing field.   But we were completely wrong.   It has ended up being the exact opposite.

Before the Internet in the physical world it was a lot harder to have concentration.    There was a natural barrier.

The connectivity of the Internet is what has enabled the mega corporations like Google, FB, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon.

Right now as I type this the largest companies in the world are dominated by tech companies.   

So they are already mega corporations.  But look at the latest financial results.   Last quarter Google reported they increase profits by more than 40% YoY.  That is NOT a typo.  Google is already just HUGE and yet still able to grow top line by over 20% and bottom line by over 40%!!!!

But what people do not realize is these companies have barely even got started.   Companies like Google and Amazon have tons and tons and tons of runway to work with.

These companies also own assets that are just can NOT be replicated.   Perfect example is YouTube.     

What I believe should be done is a special tax applied to all the big tech companies.    I believe this will ultimately happen but it is a long time off.

The tax should be used to fund a UBI.   The thing that has not yet happened is the job loss.  That will eventually happen.

"I don't think there's a robust market for competing, modern word processors, so I can't tell you which brand of word processor is way better than Microsoft Word, but I can say from daily use that Microsoft Word isn't great software. When you get into specific functions you use frequently, many of them are very poorly implemented in ways that slow down your work and annoy you, when they could have been quick and simple and more direct.

Take counting words, for example. It's bad at it, it'll give you a display that says you're on page x out of y, but for words it won't say which word number you're on, and won't keep track of words in a chapter or section, nor display any word counts in the document map. If you're trying to edit a section down to 2000 words, you have to keep leaving where you're working, selecting the whole section from its header, executing a word-count to check, then going back to find your place.

Or take bookmarking, for when you want to mark places in your document you could jump back to. For one built-in default bookmark (the place you left-off in the document at the last edit), it acts nice, and displays the bookmark along the right scroll bar so you can easily see it and jump to it. But you can't add any other bookmarks or paperclips or anything to the right scrollbar, you have to go into this bookmarks dialog that looks vintage 1990's, where that default bookmark looks like a long, cryptic alphanumeric passcode, and start into a process of adding, curating, and descriptive naming for bookmarks that will only appear listed in that dialog box.",1613839731,0

"Thank you. Glad someone with your credentials responded to my query. First off, want to say I believe patents serve a purpose and are necessary, but more and more I feel it's companies, not inventors owning these patents and companies have a lot of power/money to lobby congress to make sure these patents generate the most profits forever. 
Q2: ""OK but how can companies afford to pay these salaries before they have even made their product?""
Microsoft, Google, Apple, FB, etc. Are richer than most countries. The problem seems to be the law must be designed to protect the little guy who makes something, but all the patentable products are owned by a corporation, made by an employee.
Maybe I'm just a bitter old man. I bought a Windows 10 laptop a few months ago. Office 360 should be illegal. Pay for software forever and ever. No. The guy who wrote the original word probably did so in the 80's. Is he getting a piece of this? No. 
Again, I want to thank you. I've gotten some great responses. IMO, the greatest outcome for consumers seems to be a compromise between theory and practice. I look at patent law through the lens of these patent holders are sociopathic corporations and must be shaped to serve ppl while also looking out for the little guy in his garage, however rare he may be.",1613905701,1

"&gt; I‚Äôll accept that when Linux, et.al. are as ubiquitous and easy to use as IOS or Windows. Right now they are limited to use by tech people who are donating their time. Hardly a business model; and an exception to the rule.

You're limiting yourself to consumer devices. In the server space, that's nearly 100% linux. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc. all run Linux. Additionally, Android is a heavily modified Linux, so technically, it's running on a majority of the world's phones.

&gt; Also, Gnome looks like a Russian knockoff of windows 95. Hardly innovative.

Many innovations actually come from the opensource world. If you're happy about using some kind of app store or central repository to install your apps/software, that's been in the linux world for more than 2 decades.

Elasticsearch (previously mentioned) is probably what's running your internal search, tracking your server logs, etc.

We have hit a point like movies where we have very strong IPs and formulas that are known to work. Taking chances on new ways to play is risky so you still only see that in indie titles and why microsoft and sony are buying up those companies.

It's much easier to watch a mediocre TV show or movie since you don't spend as much time vs a game that might take playing 2-3 hours before you finish the tutorial area. Reviewers are biased and while they can help avoid broken games, social media tends to be polarizing for everything.

Take no man's sky, clearly a game that missed the mark when it was released. However it is now arguably one of the best games of the genre (survival exploration).  The amount of free content updates has changed the game entirely. When you look at reviews, they are all before any updates.

When you have reviews of triple AAA franchise usually it's, if you like the series you so like this with more of the same and (insert some minor improvement). This is not necessarily bad because the majority of people say they want more of that experience. That's what triple AAA titles give you. A consistent experience that takes little chances even in art design.

I personally have moved to playing lots more indie games because while they are usually not as polished, they try new things. They also tend to be more focused experiences that are shorter. Things like ori, super hot, dead cells, call of the sea, etc. Game pass games it easy because I can't have to worry about not liking the game and avoid reviews so I can decide if I enjoy the game without reviewer bias.",1613930813,1

"&gt; For example, the whole Cambridge Analytical scandal was FB making it easy for users to share data about both themselves and their friends with a shitty personality test app made by an academic, who then sold the data to CA. But there‚Äôs no sign FB made any money off that.

Yep. It's infuriating that media successfully spun this off as ""Facebook selling data"". FB actually did good. API **should** provide as open / extensive access as possible to the services. Ideally, everything user could do through service's UI, should be exposed through the API.

End result would be averting ""network effect"". Which is really the only thing, apart from competence &amp; brand (which is kinda lacking in FB's case, really) which enables ""platform monopolies"". There could be other social media platforms if APIs were open as I described. People could simply connect through them, and still access their friends who stay on Facebook.

You're a outlier... Malicious software, like scams, aren't targeted at people who understand them. If you are aware of the malicious software on your machine, it wasn't  you weren't it's targeted demographic.  


Malicious software designed for MacOS is probably not less common than malicious software designed for Windows or Linux.  


Malicious software for Mac and Linux are simply *estimated* to be engineered less frequently, as those machines make up a smaller portion of the standard consumer's home computer market. There's simply more people to exploit and thus more money in engineering malicious software for Windows.  


The dirty truth is: both Windows and MacOS are closed source, No one but Microsoft and Apple modify or review their own code. So they only implement bug/exploit fixes as a reactionary process after exploits are revealed and processed through their organization's red tape. This can sometimes take days, weeks, or decades from the time an exploit is used.  


However, I'd argue that malicious software for Apple computers is more lucrative, thus more common, than any other system, because a larger portion of apple users are incompetent when it comes to computer security and all of them have enough disposable income to purchase a computer that comes with branding fees.  


It's truly impossible to say which operating system receives malicious software the least, as the only things preventing malicious software are responsible browsing habits and the number of people finding exploitable code and fixing it.",1614013658,-1

What net neutrality really does is shift the cost from the platforms to the pipes. That's why YouTube is free, Netflix is low cost but your wireless and ISP bills are sky high.

Since the carriers can't charge YouTube or Netflix more for using a huge amount of data the cost is passed along to who they can charge: customers.

Anyone dealing with the costs associated to deliver the data is often against it. Aka Verizon, AT&amp;T, TimeWarner/Spectrum

This isn't quite a proper comparison. Though you CAN use those consoles for other purposes than gaming, the average user is purchasing them for their gaming abilities and content lists. Meanwhile the iPhone is a phone first, app platform second, and smartphones aren't REALLY considered gaming platforms by the wider public at large.

Furthermore, the comparison fails further still because while Microsoft has a monopoly on what content makes it to the XBox and Sony to the PS, what they are controlling is entry to their particular console and nothing further. There are exclusivity contracts, and of course development studios owned by both are likely to push console exclusive games, but these are either situations where the studio is being PAID to be exclusive or is exclusive by their own uncoerced choice. Meanwhile Apple does not give its app developers economic incentives to be exclusive, only economic disincentives (punishment) for violating exclusivity.

To put it another way, Microsoft and Sony do not punish a developer for supporting the capability of customers to load their games on a jailbreaked version of the console though they reserve the right to punish the customer for doing so, meanwhile Apple is targeting the developers.",1614198455,-1

It is not really about search result links either, what it is about is the likes of Google, and even more so Facebook, scraping data from news sites and using it as content in their other products like Google News/YouTube, and Facebook feeds, an earlier post provides a great example, which ironically is the ABC: https://old.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/l2ccmy/google_holding_australia_to_ransom/gk5hreu/

This is done by the likes of Google and Facebook to drive ad revenue, for which they already have an overwhelming monopoly.

I appreciate old media and the likes of Microsoft stand to benefit from potential changes. But the likes of Google and Facebook also long benefited from the status quo, in being able to appropriate content that they do not generate and so far do not pay for.

But behind all that you need to look at it from a non-US perspective, a growing concern is that big tech is doing social damage, including to democracy itself, and unlike comparable industries, say mining in Australia, big tech does not pay significant levels of tax in most of the non-US countries it is doing harm in. So there are growing bipartisan political reasons to see big tech as a burden and social cost, rather than a benefit, particularly as big tech is being weaponized against politicians themselves.

What big tech has in its favor is the network effect, particularly Facebook and the likes of YouTube. Facebook has just used its nuclear option in shutting off news in Australia. At the moment Australia is taking the soft option, accepting that the network effect will always result in a monopoly and encouraging the dominant players to negotiate within a legislative framework.

But if that does not work, non-US countries may need to consider the possibility of a retaliatory nuclear option, and that is non-US countries banning together to create laws that force a break up of that network effect outside the US, deliberately opening the space for new players, knowing that in the end there will only be one, but insisting that one be compliant in a regulatory framework.

That may sound far fetched to someone in the USA, but if big tech, and Facebook in particular, continue to behave in the manner they are, with the escalating cost to non-US citizens and governance, then there will be increasing incentive for non-US nations to consider the core issue, that big tech's value is proportionate to the extent and sole domination of a network, and hence look at deliberately legislating in a coordinated manner to disrupt that.

And the storming of the Capitol may itself fuel a solidification of what seems to be similar growing US bipartisan political concerns as to the social and democratic cost of big tech.

Think of it as inviting change, but if that does not work then resorting to the necessity to deliberately disrupt the disruptors ;-)",1614209166,1

Now if iOS isn't a monopoly gaming platform, this means that EPIC has choices to not release its game on iOS but still release its game.

*If* (**hypothetically**) we take the above to be true, then this gives a bit more credence to Apple's argument that its actions make it a more attractive platform. After all EPIC, and all the other game companies ""getting screwed by Apple"" could move their games away overnight and make Apple lose all value it has as a gaming platforms. But they stick, because it's not as terrible as EPIC puts it, that is they chose to go into the platform, because they saw it as a good opportunity. They weren't forced, they actually took the effort to get their game running on iOS.

&gt; In fact, apple disallowed stadia on ios saying that every single game most be individually added to the app store and subject to apple handling all payments and using the review system.

Apple is free to consider how their phone should work and what is fine and what isn't. Moreover if Stadia is truly the amazing app that makes people's lives better they'd choose an Android phone. Anti-trust requires that the company's control harm the markets ability to self-regulate. If a company doesn't control the majority of the market, then you can't say its actions are forced.

So in the case of Microsoft it controlled so many of the world's computers, that by controlling the software they ran on these machines, they were able to control the Internet, killing any innovation or improvement that a competitor could cause. Moreover what Microsoft was choosing was to not invest on the internet, and by extension, not allowing anyone else to either. This is why after the anti-trust case you saw a browser renaissance followed by an explosion of web improvements.

Here this won't trigger any change. Apple has a strong position, but they don't quite have that much power on the markets. Apple has dragged its feet on a lot of features and software that first came to Android and then decided to catch up.

Take the keyboard, for example. Android is very open and lets people install different keyboards. The iPhone does not. Because of this Androids have had superior keyboards for a really long time. Even features that I consider critical (such as swipe to type) only came out on iOS 13.

Apple couldn't prevent someone inventing a better keyboard than they had, because there was competition with other phones. If Apple controlled 99% of the phones out there, you could argue that they're stifling the innovation in the field with no justification.

The difference is that in the current scenario Apple couldn't prevent keyboard innovations, and market dynamics made it such that Apple ended up copying features. In the anti-trust scenario no one could ever offer these alternatives because Apple would prevent them.

Similarly if the browsing experience is sub-par on iPhone, people will switch more and more to Android. Unless it happens that it doesn't matter and people don't care about it.

Anti-Trust is not about corporate freedom to do what they want on another platform (for that you want things like FCC's Title II). Anti-Trust is about not doing actions that prevent a fair market.

&gt; They said you could just make it a browser app which was eventually done, but apple gave Amazon a head start.

Apple didn't give them a head start. Amazon was the one that found the loophole. Apple simply validated it. Why didn't Google research this earlier? Maybe because they gave Android priority, and that's their prerogative to. Why didn't Nvidia or others? Maybe they didn't realize they could do this workaround, or didn't have enough experience understanding the rules of iOS. Amazon has apps on it, and doesn't have loyalty to one phone store over another.

&gt; The funny thing is that apple made these the rule changes as stadia and xcloud were about to be released to ios.

As a reaction to. And it's Apple's prerogative to do that. That's not anti-trust. The question is if Apple's actions are preventing the market dynamics.

Apple can make the argument that for people that want streaming games using stadia, they can always buy an Android. Just like someone who wants to play Gears of War can always buy an XBox, and this doesn't give Sony the ability to sue Microsoft for anti-trust. Exclusive media is not anti-trust because it's part of the package you can choose to buy or not. At that point were do we draw the line otherwise? Are menus? OS? The fact that I can't run iOS on my Android phone, does that mean there's an anti-trust case? What about the fact that I can't run Windows? Or DOS?

&gt; Luna unsurprisingly is not available on android yet.

Not surprising at all. Those two companies have always clashed in their stores and protocols. But again not anti-trust.

&gt; Apple is willing to work with Amazon to allow no commission renting of movies because reasons.

That's their prerogative, and what Amazon may be giving them in exchange or not may be different. Again not anti-trust if it doesn't prevent market systems from changing. Android could always offer the killer feature iOS doesn't and take that sweet extra 25% of mobile users.

&gt; Apple is far worse than Microsoft.

Maybe, but the fact that a company does an anti-trust action doesn't mean all their actions are anti-trust.

&gt; Saying people can buy other devices is not a great argument of apple is arguing their store is more like steam than microsoft.

I think that it's not saying ""they can buy elsewhere"" but that ""EPIC is free to sell games on a myriad of platforms that are not the iOS store"" and that's enough to argue that this isn't anti-trust. If this actions result in iOS being an inferior platform for games, then games, and gamers, will move elsewhere.

&gt; Especially when both stores don't even have fortnite.

The argument isn't about fortnite. The argument is that EPIC wants to be able to milk users even more through micro-transactions on their phone systems. It just so happens that fortnite is in the right place strategically to make this argument: it's enough of a game (and not a slot machine with extra steps) that it could bring in sympathy of people (and fans), but fortnite has been losing popularity, so the risk of losing players in iOS (and only iOS) is small enough. But the goal is not fortnite, and it never was about that specific game.

The point is that EPIC has many alternatives they could use. They can pull their games of iOS and, if EPIC is right, it will be Apple's loss.

Or maybe not. Maybe the point is that people get access to a mobile platform, and that's a separate enough experience than you can't use consoles or PCs as alternatives. And you could also argue that, while Apple doesn't control the market of phones, it has a huge defacto influence by everyone targeting both, that if either Apple or Google say something doesn't go, then it just doesn't, independent of what the market would have preferred.

This isn't David vs. Goliath. And there isn't a good or a bad company. Here's two companies, making arguments (non of which are good for the consumers) out of their own greed. It's up to the court to decide if either is right.",1614228886,1
"&gt; Note that Apple isn't punishing anyone for violating exclusivity.

But they are.

Apple only has so much ability to say ""It was your choice to violate my rules."" on a platform of general use that they control. A rough guide on how to think of it from a legal standpoint is that if the existence and enforcement of a rule is entirely about the rule-creator making money and the punishment involves the rule-creator making less money, then this has the potential to run afoul of monopoly laws. Obviously that statement is overly broad but it's purpose still stands.

In particular, one point that was raised early on is that Apple's ecosystem is a further difference between them and Microsoft or Sony or Nintendo with their consoles. And that's that those three companies vet every single game that is releasing on their consoles commercially. You don't get to pump out XBOX CDs for your game without the Microsoft certification, which includes both a technical side (they make sure that my game cannot brick your console) and a content side. Though generally used sparingly, all three companies can and will block games with content they do not agree with. Meanwhile with Apple, their automated vetting system is streamlined to do a quick ""Does it seem like this app is accessing parts of the phone we said people shouldn't?"" and some basic technical safety checks, before you get your rubber stamp of approval.

This is an extremely meaningful distinction, because it means that despite the variety they hold, Xbox, Playstaion, and Nintendo are closed ecosystem. You don't get to join without their say-so. But the Apple ecosystem is inherently an open ecosystem that they will remove you from if it later comes to their attention that you were violating their policies/desires. Open ecosystems don't get to have required membership fees AND be able to exclude members simply because the member in question is nibbling from their pie.

I do think all sides of Australian politics are anxious about Murdock and the disproportionate effect his opportunistic profiteering bias may have, but I have yet to see any evidence that has influenced the ACCC, which is clearly focused, as it should be, on the market imbalance: https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/accc-releases-preliminary-report-into-google-facebook-and-australian-news-and-advertising

I appreciate old media and the likes of Microsoft stand to benefit from potential changes. But the likes of Google and Facebook have also long benefited from the status quo, in being able to appropriate content that they do not generate and so far do not pay for.

"That's a bit of a strained argument.

And Apple is as much a closed ecosystem as anything else. So is Android, the whole point that in order to call your phone Android it has to have the Google Play Store and cannot have any other is because its a close ecosystem.

And Apple hasn't played themselves as weak or wounded. They are merely stating ""EPIC has no argument and they're acting hurt and weak when in reality they make a lot more money from elsewhere"". Apple isn't saying it's being bullied, but simply that it's not really bullying EPIC, it's just standing its ground.

Again how valid that is depends on the culture.

&gt; Apple owns 49% of the smartphone marketshare in the United States

If 50% of computers were Apple, you could argue that Apple would want to have superior browsers, like Netscape, on their OS to put pressure on their competition. Better browsers means better computers. Again market dynamics would hold then.

The problem was that at that time Microsoft software controlled almost all the PCs at the time. Both in Europe and the US.

Now Apple is no one's friend, or hero. They talk about privacy, but merely they talk about how, since they don't make money certain way, they don't do the shitty actions that making money that way requires. But at the same time they fight others.

You want good anti-trust cases? Lets talk about Apple controlling the production of hardware (that's in China though, limited in the US or EU). Or about Apple's byzantine actions against repairable devices. When Apple forbids manufacturers of their parts to sell parts to other people (to prevent repair and replacement of them) that's an anti-trust action. The consumer is limited on what can and cannot be repaired by Apple's actions. While Apple can choose to not sell the parts it produces, it cannot tell it's providers who they can sell to or not. That actually has [clear cut examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastman_Kodak_Co._v._Image_Technical_Services,_Inc.).

But the guys who get hurt by this are not multi-billion companies, so they don't have the resources to push an anti-trust case.

I'm not taking sides here. EPIC's argument is not strong, at least not as presented. Things may change in the future as more evidence comes up and the case is better formed.

So again, is Apple doing an anti-trust action here? That depends on how the court looks at it. Is EPIC out of line here? That depends on how the court looks at it.

Is it wrong that EPIC is pushing this? Not really, if they believe they have a case they have the right (and obligation) to push it. It's up to the court to either agree with them or not. Is Apple a victim here? No. Is EPIC a victim here? No.

"Android is pretty explicitly not a closed ecosystem.

Not only can any company or individual freely alter Android to their own whim, but the only real control Google and the other major brands exhibit over their variously flavored app stores is the technical (this app won't brick the phone) tests, and very VERY lightly content (in the form of ""This is a million dollar app. It does nothing, but its existence on your phone shows you can afford it."") filter.

Apple controls their OS with an iron fist, Google does not.

Apple pretends their app-store is a closed ecosystem when it isn't, Google does not.

This is not a good comparison.

&gt; If 50% of computers were Apple, you could argue that Apple would want to have superior browsers, like Netscape, on their OS to put pressure on their competition. Better browsers means better computers. Again market dynamics would hold then.

Steve Jobs himself once gave a lovely speech that the problem with reaching the top market share is that the opposite is true. Once you have captured the majority of the market, technical innovations and quality of life improvements result in measurably smaller market gains, whereas increased sales programs are now primarily responsible for increased market share. Your product is already the top product, people believe this to be true. They want it because they already know it's the best. Making it better doesn't alter that reputation. People adopt it because you manage to convince them to and once something has the public status of 'the best' it doesn't matter if it isn't anymore because the average person doesn't take the time to research that. What innovation does, is increase costs for a company that is now only concerned with increasing profits, which can be done by finding a few more drops of blood to squeeze out of the stone of market share or by cutting costs. An 8K screen is going to convince basically nobody to get a new iPhone, so why bother spending billions figuring out how to make an energy efficient 8K screen for the next iPhone?

What happens is that innovation gradually gets turned down more and more, while sales increase because more effort is being pushed into sales. And this teetering house of cards comes crashing down when all of a sudden huge portions of your customer base realize that the other products out there are just vastly superior because you spent so long resting on your laurels that any innovation you once had is last years news. And thus you get the fall of IBM, Xerox, etc.

*cough cough* Putting out a 'new' MacBook Pro with the same hardware specs for something like 5 years running. *cough cough*

&gt; The problem was that at that time Microsoft software controlled almost all the PCs at the time. Both in Europe and the US.

And they CONSTANTLY were hit with lawsuits based around limiting their monopolistic behaviors and activities. And you know what? They lost a LOT of those cases, or in many situations what could be said is that even when they didn't outright lose, they also didn't outright win the case which given the relative positions of Microsoft and their opponent (usually Apple) was as good as losing.

&gt; You want good anti-trust cases? Lets talk about Apple controlling the production of hardware (that's in China though, limited in the US or EU). Or about Apple's byzantine actions against repairable devices.

Oh of course EPIC doesn't give a shit about the end user, but this is one of those (rare) cases where what's good for one billion dollar company is inherently good for the rest of us. If they win, then the likely result is that Apple may no longer expel developers from in-app microtransactions that Apple gets no cut of (relatively low chance of this one), combined with not being able to expel developers for simultaneously having their apps on non-Apple owned app stores (high chance).

The end result is that alternate app-stores on the iPhone gain a flood of content overnight and they become much more likely to be used by consumers (despite the technical knowhow necessary to jailbreak the phone and access them). More choice for the consumer is basically never a bad thing.",1614249945,1

Most of the counter arguments to this are revolving around some notion of nature vibes ‚Äútechnology bad, hold the line, they can‚Äôt make me‚Äù drifting further down into weirdo territory the longer the discussion goes. If you have a company/are self employed, not using social media is a ridiculous thought at this point.

That's why they're slow to adopt a lot of the new crawling and indexing features that Google comes out with. 

With a singularly focused indexing entity, you'd have the budget to not only catch up faster but also set new standards. If there were 100 search engines using this global index engine, then digital marketers would slowly start to build for it instead of Google, which would take away Google's power when it comes to algorithm changes.

Another thing is bias. Google is biased towards its own products and towards ads. A non for profit would have no commercial bias which makes it easier to build completely new ranking systems for the results. You can ask for your results to be sorted by back-link authority, Twitter authority, brevity, locality, etc.

The one issue is integration. Google and Microsoft both run a lot natural language processing on the query (which may be why DDG is inferior to Bing) because they have proprietary algorithms and the computational budget for it. They also open their maps for you, if needed. Third party tools would have to specialize and collaborate to become better on all fronts.

Indexing as utility isn't sufficient but it's necessary.",1614805576,1
"There were plenty of search engines indexing the web before google. They were terrible. Google‚Äôs success has more to do with their advancements in machine learning like pagerank and BERT. 

Also, i don‚Äôt see the value in creating a search monopoly to combat a search monopoly. Why would we expect a search indexer with a guaranteed flow of income to outperform google which invests massively in R&amp;D to stay competitive.

"IRC is a protocol there is even effort to a version 3 with added features.  But in the end it is a bit limited and not necessarily fitted for the use case of Slack or Discord.  IRC is still the primary communication in some underground inheriting from the hacker scene: opensource and software piracy. I guess the security community is still on IRC.

Then having a protocol is not enough, you need good clients and a user base to adopt it!   Jabber is a great protocol, the idea was to unify again instant chat communities which over time had ICQ, AIM, microsoft messenger.   Both google and facebook originally based their instant chat upon jabber protocol. I guess the then faced limitations and went with their own system instead (which is fast) of improving the Jabber spec (which is slow cause of many parties involved).

The reason TCP or HTTP are still there is that you don't really much other options. Though http got vastly improved recently.


We could have a non profit for chat or video or anything, and there are. But people have to start adopting those alternatives instead of sticking with the easiest choice.

"Revising section 230 is the last thing you want - And anyone who wants it changed has clearly never taken the time to understand what it is, does, or why it exists in the first place. Or read it.

Section 230, in basic terms, makes it so places like Reddit can exist.

Prior to section 230, a website that accepted user content was 100% liable for what their users put on their website. Someone uploaded Child Porn? Guess what! You're Liable for it, *even if you removed it immediately.* Same thing for if a user calls someone a giant bitch, and they decide to sue for Libel. But that's only if you moderate it. If you don't moderate it, then the liability goes to the users. (These things were ruled in 1990 and 1994).


""No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.""

That is section 230.

It means you can't sue Reddit over somthing someone posts about you.

That's it.

The reason the Democrat Senators were freaking out is because removing it is akin to allowing censorship, and sponsoring it at the highest levels.

Anyone could sue any website for the smallest slight, and it would utterly destroy the internet overnight. People would sue Microsoft, Reddit, Twitter, Google, for the most innocuous things. Eventually, assuming they didn't immediately leave the country, they would succumb to death by a thousand cuts.

"&gt; If a grocer does enough damage to have the related fines bankrupt the company, the company probably deserves bankruptcy.

The point is that the bar for ""bad enough to bankrupt the company"" is going to be a lot lower for someone like Amazon than it is for a grocer.  We can use GDPR as a proxy here.  Amazon and a grocery store are both found guilty of mishandling user data.  Something about their rewards program was bad.  Are you going to fine the grocery store 0.5% of it's revenue, and like 10% of Amazon's revenue?  Those numbers equate to a roughly equal decrease in operating income, assuming a 40% margin for Amazon.

It's also worth noting that you're going to end up fining Amazon for revenue that was entirely unrelated to the issue at hand.  The union issues have literally nothing to do with AWS.  There is no push for a union among AWS, as far as I know.  Nobody in AWS is affected by the conditions in warehouses.

The other side, which is often ignored, is that the US benefits from the effective monopoly big tech has.  Like, a lot.  FANG + Microsoft is 10% of the value in the S&amp;P 500.  A huge portion of our economic productivity comes from them.  If you want to fine Amazon enough that it hurts, get ready to feel that pain, because we'll all suffer.  Hopefully they'd course correct and stop doing whatever it is they were fined for, but in the mean time, it's going to hurt investor confidence.  Amazon shares will tank, and they're large enough to cause full percentage point swings in the S&amp;P 500.  It will likely hurt confidence in other big tech as well, which will add to the dip.  I get that fucking over the big investors is fine, but there are a lot of 401ks invested in index funds.  The prevailing advice for normal people looking to invest is to invest in an index fund.  This is going to hurt those, immensely.  Like, ""it's going to take a couple years to get back to where you were"" kind of hurt.

Those fines are also likely to come out of the R&amp;D budget.  Profitability is low, I don't think they do dividends, they dump pretty much everything into R&amp;D.  In an isolationist economy, that's basically fine.  We only compete internally, another competitor will take it over.  In a global environment, making our companies less competitive comes with a very real chance that a huge part of our GDP ends up going to some other country (likely China, given their rapidly advancing tech sector).

"It seems to me you're missing the intent of these fines in the first place.  If a grocer by some unbelievable twist of fate manages to do an amount of damage that is comparable to the damage done by Amazon while breaking the law, then they should be fined a comparable amount.  The fines levied should be commiserate with the *damage caused*, and CAPPED by the revenue the company receives.  Thus a judge will determine what the exact value of the fine is, but has the capacity to levy much larger fines (if the damage is sufficient enough) against companies that have deeper pockets.

This is some jank libertarian logic right here.  I am not willing to turn a blind eye to damages caused by large corporations simply because they may benefit me slightly.  This isn't a ""greater good"" equation here.  Companies need to be held accountable *proportionate to the damage they cause*, and if needed with some added punitive fines to dissuade other companies from following that same route.

&gt; A sophisticated attack on Microsoft&amp;#039;s widely used business email software is morphing into a global cybersecurity crisis, as hackers race to infect as many victims as possible before companies can secure their computer systems.

&gt; The rapidly escalating attack came months after the SolarWinds breaches by suspected Russian cyberattackers, and drew the concern of U.S. national security officials in part because the latest hackers were able to hit so many victims so quickly.

These are the 'types' of innovation the private sector excels at, where one existing product hasn't quite managed to become cheap enough or easy enough for the general public to enjoy. And if you look at the results, you see how vastly disproportional the profits are to the 'contribution'... Facebook being the most egregious example... a handful of people offering a product with no 'technical' innovation gets to become a multi-billion dollar company, while those that laid the foundation get nothing (not the inventor of the WWW (Tim Bernard Lee), the Internet (Darpa), or the packet switching developer).

Take as an example the recent resurgence in Artificial intelligence, you will find examples of Private contribution particularly as you go back in history to around the time of WW2 (but again there is a reason for that, with massive Public subsidy at the time)... but overwhelmingly you find all roads lead back to a few academic in Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun, etc. Their work in the 1990, 2000's was not privately funded, as the private sector had no idea it was going to work... its too risk adverse and very hard to retain the profits.

Now you can 'imagine' the private sector eventually cracking the problems that Hinton and LeCun did... but there is a clear pattern in the types of innovation that the public sector creates, and they are important enough not to be interfered with... I don't know how to assign an economic value to Einstein, Turing or Maxwell (but it is immense) and neither does the Private sector.",1615290404,1

&gt; RESTON, Va. - Cyber sleuths have already blamed China for a hack that exposed tens of thousands of servers running Microsoft&amp;#039;s Exchange email program to potential hacks.

&gt; Mandia said his company assesses based on the forensics that two groups of Chinese state-backed hackers - in an explosion of automated seeding - installed backdoors known as &amp;quot;Web shells&amp;quot; on an as-yet undetermined number of systems.

&gt; Mandia compared the Exchange hack with the SolarWinds hacking campaign that Washington has blamed on elite Russian intelligence agents that his company discovered in December.

"&gt; I haven't ignored it. I explained to you that there already exists cheaper and faster methods that are far more user friendly and convenient.

Please point out any methods that a company or person can use for international money transfers that takes less than 24 hours and costs less than bitcoin regardless of the volume being sent.  They dont exist despite your insistence.

&gt; It wipes out their profit margin if you buy something and then the next day when you need to use it, it drops 10% in value.

Holding anything, even Bitcoin, as a reserve asset has no effect on profit margin.  Its no different than people hedging cash reserves in gold or stock of other companies.  What Tesla and Microstrategy did buying bitcoin has no effect on their day to day operations.  This is free cash they are holding in bitcoin because of its deflationary properties.  There is no effect on their profit margin.  Although, ironically, Tesla has made more profit from buying bitcoin than they have selling cars.

&gt; Barely any. It's all speculation.

Pay Pal, Square, Visa and Mastercard arent bringing crypto services to market because of speculation.  Microsoft, Apple and Amazon arent developing crypto services because they are speculating. 
 There are legitimate businesses that have been operating for half a decade allowing bitcoiners to pay bills.  Even Jamie Dimon said he's scared shitless about the competitive threat of crypto over the next 10 years, especially once big tech starts building easily accessible services for consumers and leverages them across their varying ecosystems.

Bitcoins effects on climate change are a drop in the bucket compared the energy demands of the next 50 years.  The real problem that I've maintained from the beginning is related to fossil fuel production driving climate change no consumers of energy like bitcoin.  Attacking the consumers of energy, regardless of your personal opinions, doesnt solve the problem.  It's like fighting the war on drugs by arresting the addicts and we all know how massively that has failed for over 50 years.

And what are you talking about cornering global markets???  Global market of what?  He doesn't work for Microsoft.  And he gives away vaccines.  So he will corner the market in giving away vaccines?

Yes, it is true that Bill suggested that Oxford not open-license the vaccine they were working on.  But did you know that Bill had given $384 million towards the development of the vaccine?  I am sure your mind spins that to making him even more evil.  But did you also know that Oxford was not finished with the vaccine they were working on?  If they had just left it as is and open-sourced their work, it might never have been finished.  

Why would a pharmaceutical company spend money to finish an open source vaccine, when they can make their own and make more money?  

So Bill suggested that Oxford make a deal with a pharmaceutical so that they could get additional funding to finish the vaccine.  An unfinished vaccine helps no one.  And Oxford made the Pharmaceutical company agree to make the vaccines affordable.  Do you realize that without that in writing,  a pharmaceutical could have charged more money?

Here is a source that mentions the $384 million given away.  http://aftinet.org.au/cms/node/1932

And this one talks about how they needed more money.  https://www.logically.ai/factchecks/library/c686f83d

So you can't give any away?  Somehow he gives billions away, and you won't say how much you have done, but you are so much better than he is.  Nice double standard.

No, we both do not ""know"" this.  You seem to assume if he didn't make the money from his business that the money would have gone to the poor?  I don't follow that logic at all.  How does a poor person in Africa get money from Microsoft not existing???

Also, you are assuming that another company wouldn't have made that money.  For example instead of buying a Windows computer, they would just buy a Mac.

&gt; And who cares if he donated money to research a vaccine he is now profitting off? That was an investment.

Please show a source that he is making a profit off of it.  Because everything I have read shows that he is giving away money towards vaccines so that poor people globally can get them.

"The average office worker in the United States must keep track of between 20 to 40 different username and password combinations. With so many passwords to remember, many of us use the same ones over and over, or have a running list of passwords saved somewhere. Passwords are a very serious and expensive security risk. It‚Äôs why companies like Microsoft , Apple and Google are trying to reduce our dependence on them. But the question is, can these companies break our bad habits?

Update (January 21, 2020): A website mentioned in this video, WeLeakInfo, was shut down by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies on Friday, Jan. 17, 2020. The site claimed to have more than 12 billion usernames and passwords from more than 10,000 data breaches.

Passwords are a very serious and expensive security risk. A report by Verizon looked at 2,013 confirmed data breaches and found that 29% of those breaches involved the use of stolen credentials.

Another study by the Ponemon Institute and IBM Security found that the average cost of a single data breach in the U.S. was more than $8 million. Even when passwords are not stolen, companies can lose a lot of money trying to reset them.

‚ÄúOur research has shown that the average fully loaded cost of a help desk call to reset a password is anywhere between $40 or $50 per call,‚Äù says Merritt Maxim, vice president and research director at Forrester.

‚ÄúGenerally speaking, a typical employee contacts a help desk somewhere between 6 and 10 times a year on password related issues,‚Äù Maxim said. ‚ÄúSo if you just do the simple multiplication of six to 10 times, times 50 dollars per call, times number of employees, in your organization, you‚Äôre talking significantly hundreds of thousands of dollars or even potentially millions of dollars a year.‚Äù",1615581285,1

"&gt;	DNT is not widely adopted by the industry, with companies citing the lack of legal mandates for its use, as well as unclear standards and guidelines for how websites are to interpret the header. Thus, it is not guaranteed that enabling DNT will actually have any effect at all.[10] The W3C disbanded its DNT working group in January 2019, citing insufficient support and adoption.[11] Apple discontinued support for DNT the following month.[12]

And GPC was just announced last year. Which means until the standard is finalized it run the risk of falling into the exact same hole of DNT. With respect to browsers, developers often get annoyed when browsers enable features that aren't standardized because it creates the IE problem where developers are supporting ""that thing, and then everything else"". 

Idk if you're a developer at all, or familiar with that space. But it happened not that long ago with CSS Grid, Microsoft had the only browser that was actually supporting the spec. The other browsers all kept working on it behind the scenes and then it made Microsoft look odd. People don't like ending up in these situations, so as it stands, browsers generally wait until features are *finalized* finalized before releasing a new API/whatever (excluding behind feature flags) so the internet does break, and implementation is consistent. 

See the IE section here. This references it, I can't find any articles anymore talking about the whole story. But this isn't the first time it's happened. Javascript as a whole had that issue as well

&gt; According to Microsoft corporate vice president Tom Burt, hackers first gained access to an Exchange Server either with stolen passwords or by using the previously undiscovered vulnerabilities used to &amp;quot;Disguise itself as someone who should have access.&amp;quot; Using web shells, hackers controlled servers through remote access - operated from U.S.-based private servers - to steal data from a victim&amp;#039;s network.

&gt; U.S. officials tell CBS News that while the SolarWinds hack has more national security implications given the fact that hackers in that attack accessed nine federal agencies, the attack by Microsoft is far more widespread. &amp;quot;This is definitely bigger than Solar Winds,&amp;quot; Kennedy said.

&gt; It remains unclear if the upcoming cyber executive order will also address risks posed by the latest Microsoft Exchange hack.

&amp;nbsp;

Open-source software has been proving itself over time as a way to improve security by having more visibility on security-critical code, and provides fair and transparent security for all - not just ""trusted partners"" that can turn around and weaponize exploits found. In that sense, things that are bad for Microsoft *are* good for advancing open-source software, and it has little to do with your derisive assumption that it was due to ""having to pay for"" products.

As a mental exercise, imagine if Microsoft abandoned their operating system core, and pivoted to using Linux kernel / filesystems, etc - and instead provided a paid high-quality Windows-identical GUI, Microsoft Office suites, and Microsoft services. Most of the code involved in securing the system and providing driver/firmware access to hardware would become open-source, for users it would operate identically to Windows, Microsoft would still make money as the most familiar OS environment and as a services provider, and costs could be cut trying to develop the incredibly complex software that runs the OS / hardware interaction at the lowest level. Some Microsoft development time would support kernel improvements, and all users would be benefiting from universal eyes on the code base. Depending on how they approach the issue, programs that are developed for Windows might even become more Linux-friendly, giving consumers broader choice on what to run - everyone would be running Linux, but Microsoft would earn their money by providing the best user interfaces and integration.",1615874712,1

"According to [Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-element-ai-sold-for-230-million-as-founders-saw-value-wiped-out/) article:

**Element AI sold for $230-million as founders saw value mostly wiped out, document reveals**

Montreal startup Element AI Inc. was running out of money and options when it inked a deal last month to sell itself for US$230-milion to Silicon Valley software company ServiceNow Inc., a confidential document obtained by the Globe and Mail reveals.

Materials sent to Element AI shareholders Friday reveal that while many of its institutional shareholders will make most if not all of their money back from backing two venture financings, employees will not fare nearly as well. Many have been terminated and had their stock options cancelled.

Also losing out are co-founders Jean-Fran√ßois Gagn√©, the CEO, his wife Anne Martel, the chief administrative officer, chief science officer Nick Chapados and **Yoshua Bengio**, the University of Montreal professor known as a godfather of ‚Äúdeep learning,‚Äù the foundational science behind today‚Äôs AI revolution.

Between them, they owned 8.8 million common shares, whose value has been wiped out with the takeover, which goes to a shareholder vote Dec 29 with enough investor support already locked up to pass before the takeover goes to a Canadian court to approve a plan of arrangement with ServiceNow. The quartet also owns preferred shares worth less than US$300,000 combined under the terms of the deal.

The shareholder document, a management proxy circular, provides a rare look inside efforts by a highly hyped but deeply troubled startup as it struggled to secure financing at the same time as it was failing to live up to its early promises.

The circular states the US$230-million purchase price is subject to some adjustments and expenses which could bring the final price down to US$195-million.

The sale is a disappointing outcome for a company that burst onto the Canadian tech scene four years ago like few others, promising to deliver AI-powered operational improvements to a range of industries and anchor a thriving domestic AI sector. Element AI became the self-appointed representative of Canada‚Äôs AI sector, lobbying politicians and officials and landing numerous photo ops with them, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. It also secured $25-million in federal funding ‚Äì $20-million of which was committed earlier this year and cancelled by the government with the ServiceNow takeover.

Element AI invested heavily in hype and and earned international renown, largely due to its association with Dr. Bengio. It raised US$102-million in venture capital in 2017 just nine months after its founding, an unheard of amount for a new Canadian company, from international backers including Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., Nvidia Corp., Tencent Holdings Ltd., Fidelity Investments, a Singaporean sovereign wealth fund and venture capital firms.

Element AI went on a hiring spree to establish what the founders called ‚Äúsupercredibility,‚Äù recruiting top AI talent in Canada and abroad. It opened global offices, including a British operation that did pro bono work to deliver ‚ÄúAI for good,‚Äù and its ranks swelled to 500 people.

But the swift hiring and attention-seeking were at odds with its success in actually building a software business. Element AI took two years to focus on product development after initially pursuing consulting gigs. It came into 2019 with a plan to bring several AI-based products to market, including a cybersecurity offering for financial institutions and a program to help port operators predict waiting times for truck drivers.

It was also quietly shopping itself around. In December 2018, the company asked financial adviser Allen &amp; Co LLC to find a potential buyer, in addition to pursuing a private placement, the circular reveals.

But Element AI struggled to advance proofs-of-concept work to marketable products. Several client partnerships faltered in 2019 and 2020.

Element did manage to reach terms for a US$151.4-million ($200-million) venture financing in September, 2019 led by the Caisse de d√©p√¥t et placement du Qu√©bec and backed by the Quebec government and consulting giant McKinsey and Co. However, the circular reveals the company only received the first tranche of the financing ‚Äì roughly half of the amount ‚Äì at the time, and that it had to meet unspecified conditions to get the rest. A fairness opinion by Deloitte commissioned as part of the sale process estimated Element AI‚Äôs enterprises value at just US$76-million around the time of the 2019 financing, shrinking to US$45-million this year.

‚ÄúHowever, the conditions precedent the closing of the second tranche ‚Ä¶ were not going to be met in a timely manner,‚Äù the circular reads. It states ‚Äúnew terms were proposed‚Äù for a round of financing that would give incoming investors ranking ahead of others and a cumulative dividend of 12 per cent on invested capital and impose ‚Äúother operating and governance constraints and limitations on the company.‚Äù Management instead decided to pursue a sale, and Allen contacted prospective buyers in June.

As talks narrowed this past summer to exclusive negotiations with ServiceNow, ‚Äúthe company‚Äôs liquidity was diminishing as sources of capital on acceptable terms were scarce,‚Äù the circular reads. By late November, it was generating revenue at an annualized rate of just $10-million to $12-million, Deloitte said.

As part of the deal ‚Äì which will see ServiceNow keep Element AI‚Äôs research scientists and patents and effectively abandon its business ‚Äì the buyer has agreed to pay US$10-million to key employees and consultants including Mr. Gagne and Dr. Bengio as part of a retention plan. The Caisse and Quebec government will get US$35.45-million and US$11.8-million, respectively, roughly the amount they invested in the first tranche of the 2019 financing.",1615994153,1

"I have some fundamental problems with how many corporations conduct business and wasteful consumerism in general. Over the years, I've found myself leaning increasingly socialist. However, articles like these are pure shit. They read like editorials, language chosen to inflame, and are written by individuals who don't seem to understand how anything works.

The ""trick"" Zoom used is available to everybody. Get a refund and Turbo Tax will ask if you want to put that money towards next year's taxes. As for executive compensation, how much of that is driven by profits and and rise in stock value? Their stock price jumped from under 100 in early 2020 to over 550 by October. Profit margin jumped from 4% to over 25%; that's Apple, Google and Microsoft territory. 

Even if you argue that those profits came from circumstances outside their control, the fact remains that they were the ones who capitalized on it. Despite having Teams at our disposal, my company has used Zoom for a couple of years now, because it performs well and has a more intuitive UX than anything else we've tried. Pricing was low enough that there was no hesitation in giving it a shot. So clearly, they made some good decisions which enabled their success.

&gt; The vulnerabilities at Homeland Security in particular intensify the worries following the SolarWinds attack and an even more widespread hack affecting Microsoft Exchange&amp;#039;s email program, especially because in both cases the hackers were detected not by the government but by a private company.

&gt; In December, officials discovered what they describe as a sprawling, monthslong cyberespionage effort done largely through a hack of a widely used software from Texas-based SolarWinds Inc. At least nine federal agencies were hacked, along with dozens of private-sector companies.

&gt; A hacker tried unsuccessfully to poison the water supply of a small town in Florida in February, and this month a new breach was announced involving untold thousands of Microsoft Exchange email servers the company says was carried out by Chinese state hackers.

"Fun fact: when you buy a game, most of the time you are not ""buying a game."" 


You are buying a license to use software based on the terms and conditions of the sale. Most of those terms and conditions don't really need to be mentioned but you are still beholden to the license stipulations such as the stupid one here, must always be online to use.


It is a sad state of affairs and is ripe for abuse. The corporate world has been jerked around for 30 years over this kind of crap and I guess companies are starting to believe they can do this to individual people too.

"You make an excellent case for the subscription model, but failed to address the key issue: **The price of software has tripled.**    
People usually upgrade software every 3-5 years, and the new subscription models aren‚Äôt equivalent to 1/4 of the previous prices, but *equal* to the cost of a full software license!   The cost is even greater when you‚Äôre forced to constantly upgrade, requiring everyone to learn the new platform and buy new hardware to keep up with it.   
It‚Äôs a blatant cash grab in many cases and just feels like a massive fuckyou to the consumer.  Yes, people are stupid, math is hard, and consumers make decisions on the margin, so lowering the barrier to entry sells more product, but that doesn‚Äôt justify the MASSIVE price hikes across the industry. I suppose there‚Äôs no expecting justification for raising prices, if a company can get away with it, they tragically have an obligation to their shareholders to do so. It just really sucks.   
And Netflix is such a bullshit example, I can‚Äôt believe you made that comparison! That‚Äôs like comparing your TV to the news that you watch.  One is personal property, the other is *broadcast media*.     
The subscription model might make sense for highly connected and dynamic service-based platforms like GoToMeeting, AWS, Spotify, antivirus or even online multiplayer gaming, but it‚Äôs been shoehorned into SO many other genres for no reason other than increasing the price per user.  Microsoft office, for example,!added some bullshit cloud storage that nobody asked for and is poorly integrated, even in Windows, set all of the software titles to use it by default, and then called their platform a fucking ‚Äúservice‚Äùwhen it isn‚Äôt, and nobody wants that.    
I appreciate the idea of reducing software management to a monthly fee, cancel at any time, but the prices are absurd and the inability to maintain a purchased license without funding it indefinitely is impractical and anti-consumer.    
If I traveled back in time 10 years and was asked what will be the greatest change in the world by 2020, it wouldn‚Äôt be the proliferation of smart phones, electric cars or even far-right lunacy. I‚Äôd tell them that it was universally decided that people are garbage and every product, website, news station and consumer-facing commercial enterprise is going to pivot their business model to treat you like shit and bleed you for every ounce of humanly that can be sucked off your bones and you‚Äôre going to take it.   
Can you imagine any one website 10 years ago treating its users like the average one does today? Multiple full-screen popups, tracking cookies and requirements to agree to something you can‚Äôt realistically be expected to understand before even the most basic interaction? Such a website would have been red-flagged and blacklisted by every anti-malware program and we‚Äôd call it ‚Äúcancer‚Äù.

"I have several concerns about that paper.

The first one is how much of my time was probably wasted by reading it. I really wish I hadn't read through the entire thing on my phone before looking up who that foundation's donors are-

**Current CTIC Supporters**

* Amazon
* AT&amp;T Inc.
* Charter Communications, Inc.
* Comcast Corporation
* Comcast Innovation Fund
* Google LLC
* GSMA
* Microsoft Corporation
* National Science Foundation
* NCTA
* Penn Global
* The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation
* Verizon Communications Inc.

The authors claim to be completely independent, but given that list of donors, we would all be laughably naive to assume that the choice of topic or the 20 networks they included are perfectly representative of the few hundred that now appear to be operating in the U.S.

The paper states early on: *""Although some day people may need the download speeds that FTTH makes possible, the evidence suggests little need for such speeds today.""*

It also has an anecdote attributed to ""FCC"" sometime in 2014 with no actual citation regarding availability, % uptake, or whether there are less expensive competing providers available of simply: *""The U.S. take-up rate of gigabit service remains very low""*. A reminder again that this was six years ago, and we have much higher bandwidth demands these days.

Yet shortly thereafter, it states: *""It also runs the risk of obsolescence should a better technology come along.""*

So the authors' premise 5-6 years ago was that nobody needs gigabit. But we shouldn't invest in gigabit because it might become obsolete.

Squeeze this sentence in between those above on the same page, and you have me wondering which NCTA lobbyist wrote it-  
*""Wireless technologies‚Äîsuch as 5G‚Äîand legacy copper technologies‚Äîsuch as G.fast‚Äîare also exploring ways to provide gigabit speeds without incurring the cost associated with FTTH.""*

The data starts in 2010 and ends in 2014. I don't know if you recall, but the economy wasn't doing so well in 2010, and 2014 was 6 years ago.

I'd like to see some updated data for all of those projects, and data for networks other than the ones these authors chose. I didn't catch what method they used to project future revenue and am curious how accurate their projections were, since their conclusions were based on them.

The worst thing that I could take away from the paper is that municipalities may need to budget better than the majority of the ones studied within. Municipal fiber isn't a factor at all unless there is no existing service provider willing to provide acceptable service at reasonable prices. It only exists to fill a gap in commercial service. With Verizon and AT&amp;T both halting further FTTH expansion and the majority of cable broadband services having no competition at all, municipal broadband is the only effective way I see to get underserved communities reasonable service.",1617085213,1

Literally the problem you claim isnt for the ISP's to do, but which they take funding for. Right now, 25% of rural pop has no access to broadband by government assessment. A point that promised 95% access in the 1990s! It's been so bad that they even had to change the definition  of broadband at one point to prop up numbers. A recent study (this is by times article, but you can look up study if you have access )https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/technology/digital-divide-us-fcc-microsoft.html

by Microsoft shows that 50% of the us doesnt even meet access standards of broadband. Go do a google search and look at what every bill in the last 30 years is about and you quickly realize that, yeah, the return on investments might set records for waste. So when we say nothing has been done, and you compare to nearly every other country on the planet, its embarrasing at best.",1617111623,-1
"Are you so dense to not see that this ‚Äústudy‚Äù by Microsoft isn‚Äôt altruistic either.  From the article:

*Expanding broadband also benefits Microsoft and other tech companies because it enlarges the market for their products and services. And like others, Microsoft is promoting a potential solution.*

Well no shit their numbers are higher.  It is about accessing their services.  Not everyone uses office.  Many students are given chrome books and Google docs - that will look like shit to Microsoft but I get 400 down / 25 up.

Microsoft has won a contract worth as much as $21.9bn to provide the US army with at least 120,000 augmented reality headsets, in a significant move to bring the next generation of computing to the battlefield. 
Microsoft would provide the army with ‚ÄúIntegrated Visual Augmentation System‚Äù headsets, which would help soldiers train, home in on targets or be aware of nearby threats by overlaying contextual information on top of the real world, according to an announcement on Wednesday.
Under the terms of the contract, Microsoft would provide at least 120,000 headsets to the army‚Äôs entire close combat force, a company spokesperson said.
The contract could be worth up to $21.9bn over 10 years, depending on how many devices were eventually delivered, the spokesperson added. The person declined to give a cost per device.
The US army said the contract was for an initial five years with the option to extend for a further five years.
Microsoft has already been working with the army for two years on a prototype of the product that builds on its existing smartglasses product for businesses called HoloLens. 
‚ÄúThe program delivers enhanced situational awareness, enabling information sharing and decision-making in a variety of scenarios,‚Äù said Alex Kipman, Microsoft technical fellow, in a blog post, adding that the headsets would ‚Äúkeep soldiers safer and make them more effective‚Äù. 
Microsoft shares rose 2 per cent on the news to about $236.",1617267757,1

They are also networked together, so commanders back at base can effectively see what soldiers are seeing in real time, and soldiers can receive live footage captured by drones. The mobile computers, which are fitted with artificial intelligence chips, also track soldiers‚Äô eye and hand movements live, and monitor what they say.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, developers also used the goggles to test soldiers‚Äô temperatures.

The headsets have been nicknamed ‚ÄúFrankenGoggles‚Äù by some. Some soldiers who have used them say they are as intuitive as the iPhone or likened them to following video game instructions. They first underwent army field testing in October 2018 after Microsoft won a $480m contract to provide the army with prototypes.

Close to 100 Microsoft employees at the time petitioned the company to cancel that contract, arguing that it should not develop ‚Äúany and all weapons technologies‚Äù.

Peter Singer, who studies the future of warfare, said the goggles were a ‚Äúremarkable‚Äù development that could deliver quicker and better decision-making to soldiers on the ground, but warned that they could also face information overload and the risk of faulty data.

Separately in 2019, Microsoft beat tech rival Amazon to clinch a $10bn contract to provide cloud computing services to the US Department of Defense. Amazon is currently challenging the so-called Jedi contract in federal court.",1617267821,-1

"&gt; Hard to incentivize devs to build windows phone apps when there aren't enough users

Not really. You just attack the problem from a couple of different ways. 

First start giving Windows Phones away when people buy Windows laptops and desktop PCs. Make them the cheapest or free option for places like Verizon and AT&amp;T. Offer free phones to ""beta testers"" and Youtube personalities to play with and talk about. Microsoft should have done this from the beginning instead of trying to sell ""flagship phones"" like Google and Apple do. There is no reason why every 14 year old shouldn't have had a free Windows Phone and once that happens you'd have a generation of customers who grew up on your platform.

After that you aggressively partner with companies like Facebook and Google. Let them run *their own ads* inside of their apps. Let them keep 100% of the profits generated by their apps. *Pay them directly* for app support for your platform and offer them things they want. For instance Microsoft could have let Google be a default search partner for Cortana on mobile and desktop.

The problem is that Microsoft wanted to control everything because it is used to controlling everything. That strategy doesn't work when you're the weak newcomer in a growing market you've been late to adopt.",1617293748,1

The other big problem which I haven't seen lately but don't know is fixed, is the Microsoft account login system was prone to errors, one of which made you think you lost all your documents because it logged in with a temporary account.  Which leads to the other issue, domain vs pro vs home, local vs microsoft account login, all create a completely different user experience.

- Browser updates still tied to OS updates, even though the whole playing field has shifted to ever-green browser auto-updates.

It's not part of *any* major data company's business model.  You all need to stop parroting this.

Google isn't going to profit once selling Ford a list of people who are interested in cars.

Apple is 100% doing that. They refuse to comply with the FBI because they *do* have that data and it's good PR to stand up for your customers.  Supporting ""user privacy"" is a good thing, but it's also in Apple's best interest because it means *only they* know anything about you.",1617377512,1

Apple is only forcing everyone to show these labels just because the labels are designed specifically to make themselves look the best and make everyone else look the worst. A lot of the labels are far more scary than what they really represent.

"&gt;My observation with Apple's OS for Mac over the last 15 years is that  they're moving in the direction of locking it down like they have iOS,  not the other way around.

You'll also notice a parallel effort to increase monetization of services on macOS - I wonder if that's at all related?

&gt;Epic/FortNite is probably the most glaring example of challenging this purported bad motivation on Apple's part. 

How? Epic wants the ability to bypass the application review process entirely - by being allowed to create a distribution process of their own (eg: their own App Store). That would cause issues with application trust - iOS wouldn't have a single unified means of signing applications. There are absolutely some merits to that (like greater consumer freedom), but that's not really relevant here. A new web browser+engine would still need to be reviewed via the App Store review process, just like any other application.

&gt;that they do this to protect the sensitive data of their customers and to protect the UX within their ecosystem from end to end. 

There are still vulnerabilities in iOS - how do you think jailbreaking works? On top of that, there are tons of apps that break the iOS style guidelines, many of which are wildly popular and made by huge companies (looking at you, Google and Microsoft). 

&gt;  but when the alternative is to let Google sweep the entire space via Chrome 

But it's not a dichotomy - Mozilla's engine is fantastic. Outside of that, it also limits anyone new from deciding they want to try their hand at the creation of a new browser engine, so it also has the potential to stifle creativity and innovation. If Microsoft had decided in the late 90s to require any browser targeting Windows to be based on IE, we'd be in a terrible place right now.

The last 0.1% of the work to get an AI to never ever ever be controversial in any way, ever, to fine tune it to never ever do or say anything that reflects poorly on the company is a challenging task that will be dropped before it gets completed.

Truth is also no protection. Your company might think its easy enough to get AI to only ever make factual statements than can be backed up with evidence, but even then you will get an AI saying ""racist"" statements about crime statistics or perpetrators of worldwide terroism.

And then there in the deep and hidden ""between the lines"" communication that can have an AI speak of watermelon and cotton farming, both uncontroversial topics, where you are nevertheless guaranteed to find a customer willing to be offended.

Just looking at the facts of the case as they stand makes it pretty clear Apple (and Google to a lesser extent) are in violation of antitrust law.

A) People buying iPhones aren't able to install software from sources of their choosing.   This works fine for some, but restricts choice of others.

B) Apple competes on the platform *they* operate.  Let's say a video chat app better than FaceTime comes along.  Cross-platform with all the features FT has and more.   But because Apple provides FT for free, and the competitor MUST pay Apple a 30% revenue cut (since the competitor may not use anything but the App Store), the competitor is at a competitive disadvantage.

Apple, on the other hand, wins either way.

C) Apple apps play by different rules than competition is permitted to.   On iOS, Siri is the only assistant capable of full integration with the system.   You COULD download the Google assistant, but it wouldn't have a fraction the capability Siri has on iOS, giving it a competitive disadvantage.

WRONG. They offer a superior experience than any other brand of Bluetooth audio device on the market.

Not only was transferring mp3s as simple as dragging and dropping the thing still works almost 15 years later.

I‚Äôll need to purchase the Microsoft personal subscription regardless so I won‚Äôt need to pay more for access to storage (I think?). The free 5GB of storage won‚Äôt be sufficient and I need to purchase the office suite regardless.

But a smaller niche player discloses a similar exploit/vulnerability, and their business is practically toast.  The need to disclose 'publicly' should likely be subject to some sort of size concerns, and the ability of the company to contact impacted individuals directly.

Even more, when a company discloses that they've been the VICTIM of an attack, if we force them to then disclose / go out of business, we're punishing the victim of a criminal act.

"&gt;For better or worse, we've always been like this, so... maybe there's some small comfort in that.

In history it is pretty clear that our progress in this manner has almost, practically, never evolved.

&gt;I think we're still reeling from mass adoption of smartphones and social media

I perceive we are not about to stagnate in the next few generations either. I do not think Microsoft Mesh will take off. I myself cannot stand the virtual reality gear we have now and expect this will be much in the same. You do not get the same feeling out of virtual as you do in the real presence of someone. Until a true neural link like device is created that can trick the brain into believing it, seeing it as if real. I do not think this will be a massive take off. The bandwidth issue alone would be a dead battery for this. Perhaps it is even why they are pushing infrastructure right now. I also find, just from the video, this will not look real enough at all. Even the highest end graphic developments still fall gravely short of truly realistic. Until the video game and graphics developers master realism in there worlds we are not remotely likely to see a real enough version of this. Cool tech, but not going to be a hit. I see live calls being more useful if anything. Imagine Reddit but each user has an active video feed. You also have the issue of people not being true to themselves as individuals to reason with. In an office setting, neat, but what real difference would this make vs just video chats?

Climate change is happening no matter what we do. I think we need to focus more on adapting to it, rather than only trying to stop it.

People cannot even agree that the real issue with systemic racism is racial bias. We are not going to get far fast and we are going to end up worse off in some areas.

From the book you linked, we are without a doubt going the wrong way economically and although economics is so heavily linked to happiness it is being ignored. I don't know what model they think they are using now, but it isn't one based on reality or statistics.",1618435754,1
"I'm not talking about the absolute values. I'm talking about the fact that mere entertainment could also be considered wasteful. Expand that to consoles/mobile games/reddit and actually all forms of entertainment. Also, consider the benefits of cryptocurrencies. Instant, annonymous, non-reversible, decentralised digital payments (not talking about BTC). Not to mention that mining will most likely soon be replaced. It's also not like the currencies actually require such massive ammounts of energy. That's just driven by the speculative bubble/free market. Also the gpu supply chain is currently broken, not by miners, but by the fact that TSMC has to share their 7nm/5nm capacity between AMD, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Sony, not to mention any non-consumer facing companies for things like network equipement because Samsung, Intel and GlobalFoundries are out of the picture",1618444321,1
"Ah, I think you misunderstood what Microsoft Mesh is. It's not hardware, it's an SDK that developers can use for any VR/AR application they like on any device, enabled on the back end by Microsoft's cloud computing infrastructure (Azure). All it really does is solve a few major problems so that developers don't need to reinvent the wheel at every company. It'll make it much more accessible for a small team to put together at least a somewhat functional social experience. Multiplayer even in traditional games is a pain in the ass (I've done a bit of work on that front myself in the past) so having a leg up there will make a big difference on how fast we see new ideas brought to market.

As for current hardware being kind of shitty... yeah, for sure. To continue the smartphone metaphor, I think we're around the blackberry level of things. Barely recognizable as the smartphone revolution, but still starting to hit the early stages of mainstream adoption. PSVR's sold around 5 million, and the Quest 2 is around 2~3 apparently. Absolutely nothing compared to the &gt; 100 million units the PS4's sold, but if you look up sales charts, there's a very clearly visible exponential growth curve there already, and we're still very early on.

But it doesn't matter who owns the hardware, what matters is how people use it. Right now it's still too bulky, the resolution is poor, the software ecosystem is still sparse and underdeveloped, body tracking is still not great, virtually no haptics exist for the consumer market... with all that, the average VR headset owner apparently doesn't use it more than 6 hours a week. So all this definitely isn't 'here' yet, but I think you might be surprised where things are 5~10 years from now. Concepts like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg-ZakMEwDU) are projected to be maybe 5 years off, and it's possible something that easy to pick up and use could end up starting to replace the smartphone. Since it's so close to your eyes though, apparently the thought is you'll need close to 8k resolution in each eye to fully get rid of any pixelation. Trying to do PS5 level graphics (or beyond) at that resolution is well beyond current consumer hardware, but with [foveated rendering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTUmmW4ispA) (only render full clarity where the user is looking, use other tricks to fill in the periphery) you can get away with rendering vastly less of the screen, so 8k does look like it's on the horizon once foveated rendering is standard. Next gen VR headsets are mostly going to have that, so that'll start to arrive in the next two years. As far as bandwidth problems go, [there was a recent two minute papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVa1xRaHTA0) that goes into some of the new encoding methods that are becoming possible with deep learning. Instead of traditional encoders like H.264 trying to directly compress pixel data, this one encodes the video feed as just the lighting/body/face motions. An encoder like that obviously couldn't be extended to general video content, but it'd be perfect for holo-calls. You could send the motion data, and then reconstruct it on the other side into whatever avatar you're projecting at whatever level of realism your local hardware can support. Using a method like that, you could even combine it with other rendering methods to get arbitrarily realistic holo-calls at a much lower bitrate than current Zoom calls require. This isn't just a research paper either, NVidia's actively working on bringing this to market right now.

As far as the avatars themselves go... the Microsoft setup definitely isn't photorealistic, for sure... but like I said. It's all just stepping stones. [Facebook in particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETaMzMyKsG0) is really hitting the lifelike avatar research pretty hard. There won't be anything all that real and convincing this year or next probably, but in the next ten years? For sure. I think BCI 'dream' style VR would be amazing, but that one's a lot farther off. I was curious so I did a little digging in the literature a month or two ago, it looks like the first ever successful experiment inducing the experience of smelling something using nothing but direct neuron stimulation was done in 2018. I have no idea how long it'd take to mature that kind of tech to a full 5 senses experience indistinguishable from reality, but I imagine the timeline will be measured in decades, not years.

Anyway, sorry for the dump, but it's interesting stuff. I actively follow machine vision research, and this stuff's adjacent enough that I keep an eye on things. You wouldn't know it looking at consumer stuff right now, but there's crazy stuff on the near horizon. Weird as it sounds, I expect the PS5 generation might be the last gaming generation built on the classic rendering pipeline. Maybe we'll end up with a bunch of specialized neural networks hallucinating large aspects of the screen instead of relying on triangles and shading tricks ([NERF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuH79E8rdKc) for instance, or a [Semantic map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HpryLU-VI) based approach). I don't see photorealism arriving any other way, if just because the artistic talent and time required is too high.

Once all this is 'here' though in a serious way... I don't know. Maybe it won't make any more of an impact than Zoom calls, like you said. But I feel like that might end up in hindsight like the predictions that the internet wouldn't appreciably change day to day life. Part of what's got me zero'd in on this stuff is just the fact that it's a huge question mark still. I can't even really imagine what it'll mature into, but I don't think it'll be all that long before we start to see glimpses of it. I personally feel vastly less connected in a Zoom call than I do in person, so if you COULD get the tech there, I think something would come of it.

But... yeah. I'm just defending this one side of what I think will change things. No matter how big the impact, it'll just be one piece of the puzzle. I agree on all three points you made. I don't know what kind of policy changes could help create a more fair, livable society even for the people at the bottom, but... fingers crossed I guess? Feels like watching two giants go to fight, I'm just here on the ground in the background. Hopefully the titans don't fuck this up for everyone.",1618445877,1

Any admin should have known to turn on logging, but it probably is good to have it on by default.

"It was meant as a quick example of not needing a lot of effort to research the topic. The article is old and a lot of other research has come out since then. It‚Äôs easy to find. 

A server was compromised and it was then found they could escalate privileges. Office 365 was involved but was the cause in a very ‚Äúspoons make you fat‚Äù way. They were not using all the security controls that would prevent this escalation. 

From there, they were in the door and could move freely throughout the Solar Winds infra. 

Part of what they did was compromise a build server to modify dlls, injecting back doors into the Orion software, and then they executed the same type of attack in other enterprises. 

What Microsoft‚Äôs response team found, was that when enterprises were properly locked down to prevent unauthorized privilege escalation, the bad actor didn‚Äôt spend any more time there. 

In fact, this is largely why Microsoft‚Äôs OWN compromised systems did not let the attackers go far at all. 

Further, Microsoft was able to work with FireEye and isolate network traffic across their background that matched the threat, and block and prevent the further spread. 

Bottom line; supply chain was compromised by weak security, which is 110% on SolarWinds controls. The compromised dlls ran under privileged accounts in customers environments and could often move laterally and farm more privileged credentials.

I own or subscribe to all the major stuff (Adobe, Avid, Ableton, Microsoft, Google Suite, all the premium Spotify/Youtube/AppleMusic) except not Autodesk because I don‚Äôt need those ones enough to pay for it compared to free/libre... Adobe are really quite good at the soft sales side of things, free goodies, free face-to-face FAQ stuff at industry events.

I find them to be way more friendly to the consumer than Google or Microsoft or Apple, not as good as Ableton, and Avid I‚Äôm pretty neutral about.

Lots of people say that there‚Äôs no updates from year to year so you‚Äôre just paying for the same thing but I think that any pro user knows that that isn‚Äôt true at all. I even have an outright CS5 licence so I could just use that instead of the subscription but there‚Äôs new features added each year and every so often one feature will save me like a week of work a year in increased efficiency.

For some people they don‚Äôt need all the bells and whistles but you can buy lite versions of Photoshop and Premiere outright for $100 or both for $150.

If you need to edit video and you don‚Äôt need the whole shebang of Adobe/Avid/FinalCutPro then the best play is just to get the free version of DaVinci Resolve. It‚Äôs the industry standard software for colouration and they‚Äôve fleshed it out for use as an end-to-end editing program.

There‚Äôs loads of free/libre alternatives to Photoshop that would be fine for a lot of people anyway but are harder to use and don‚Äôt have as many tutorials and whatnot.

There‚Äôs a lot of interesting touchscreen-enabled ones in the Windows Store that are good on a Microsoft Surface.

If it‚Äôs for audio then there‚Äôs actually a whole lot of new competition there and Audacity is pretty good for simple stuff and is free. Look at Reaper as well which is cheap. Garageband for macOS is pretty good for free because it‚Äôs the simplified version of Logic Pro and that‚Äôs always improving because some producers use it instead of Pro Tools for some reason.

If it‚Äôs something that involves multiple of those categories then the integration between the Adobe apps is really really nice especially if you have a lot of RAM and you can keep them all open at once.

There‚Äôs a lot of freemium in-browser apps that are really good as well for certain things.

Like any tool it depends on your task and your budget but whichever one you choose it‚Äôs incredible to me how user friendly they all are compared to when I was starting out 25 years ago.

"I know how much I can make as a developer in the US. Hell, I might even go work in Cali for a while eventually, but it's not a priority right now. 

To an European company, there's no point in hiring remote employees living in CA, as you have to pay so much more so they can justify their $3000 a month or whatever rent. You can hire US based devs from low CoL cities and it wouldn't be that much more expensive than hiring devs in any of the big EU cities, but then you're hiring random American devs who aren't in any way better than random European devs, but have a timezone difference and other minor issues that come with working remote.

So unless Daimler is going to hire ex-Tesla engineers and pay them north of 200k-300k USD a year, there's really no benefit in hiring US based engineers.

Low CoL area US devs might make 100k USD a year in a decent position (some make more, but there are also /r/cscareerquestions posts with devs making under 40k in low CoL US cities), which is about 80k EUR. Now that's indeed still more than what an EU dev can expect to be paid, but it's definitely not 50% less than what a equivalent CoL US based dev would make.

So for Daimler, the options would be something like this:

1) Hire devs from Germany. 40k-100k EUR a year depending on seniority level and location maybe?

2) Open an office somewhere near the Bay Area or hire Bay Area devs to work remote. Pay 150k to 500k a year, depending on seniority level, but they'd get ex-Google, ex-Microsoft, etc, engineers.

3) US based devs, but remote and location-agnostic. Maybe pay them 60k-150k EUR, depending on seniority level. 

4) Outsource to Ukraine (through their existing contracting companies) or India. Varying costs and varying quality of code, depending on how much they're willing to pay.

Leaving the financials aside, #1 and #2 offer the most upsides. #1 because you can still keep your devs ""in-house"" and have them work on-site when COVID is over - something that Daimler as a traditional company would likely value. #2 because they could hire what could be considered to be global top talent. #3 and #4 offer no real upside, #3 is expensive, #4 is cheap.

Now, because Daimler has been around for over 100 years and likely wants to be around for at least another 100 years, they're almost certainly the kind of company that values loyal employees over extremely high-paid ""top talent"" from the US that does great work, but consists mostly of devs that are likely to job hop after 2 years.

Therefore, I'm fairly certain that they'd rather hire EU based devs than US based devs, as it's cheaper to pay EU based devs high enough rates that they'll stay around. I do doubt they'll do a mass hiring spree in the US. But they might also outsource to cheaper countries.

Actually, I think we mostly agree on the facts, we've just been ""talking past"" each other - if that saying makes any sense in English. Point is, I don't think there's much point for Daimler to hire US devs, as US devs tend to be part of one of two subsets: (extremely highly paid HCoL devs) or (slightly better paid than EU devs, but probably not particularly better or worse at their jobs than EU devs).",1618842091,1

I want to restrict access to my device only. If I lose it, I have backup codes saved and other password reset options but I shouldn't be able to choose which 2FA to use if I have passwordless setup and want it to be the default option.",1618852449,-1

"As part of Microsoft 365, of course, which means it's another way for Microsoft to try to hook businesses into their destructive business practices.

I have 20 years as an IT pro, 10 of which has been administrating Office/Microsoft 365.  It's easy to see how they've attempted to monopolize the workplace and market share by creating mediocre versions of both competitors' products and their own prior products.  Not to mention trying as hard as possible to make your business so reliant on them that it's really hard to escape, thus forcing you to stick around as they a la carte, deprecate,  or destroy the service offerings they were giving you and replace them with ones you have to pay for that are worse than what you had prior, and break your organizational workflows.  

And don't get me started on their freefalling, ever-deteriorating customer service.  They place every burden listen above on the organization to resolve, because their customer service is exceedingly polite and exceedingly impenetrable.  Their community support pages are equally useless when it comes to solving major problems.  They pretend that their service isn't at fault on those pages, and cover up support issues by pretending they don't understand.  

And when you try to search Google or Bing or some other search engine for others having the same problem that you can't get Microsoft to fix or even acknowledge, the search results for the problem are suppressed.  Many years ago it was much easier to find someone having the same problem you're having who found a workaround or could explain it.  Now, instead, you get a sea of Microsoft hits that AREN'T ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM.

Combined, this has made my job probably twice as difficult as it was even five years ago.

"It's not windows itself that makes it ""fit for daily use"" but - in general - the applications available on Windows that are part of regular user activity.

If one is a AAA gamer or use various specialized/industry software/hardware, then I can fully understand why Linux might not be a choice OS.

For the person who just does email, web-browsing, office work, Netflix, and maybe some gaming (wildly dependent on the game, DOTA yes, Battlefield no) it can be an acceptable choice. Surprisingly, even Microsoft has bitten the bullet and now maintains Linux versions of common productivity applications such as Teams.

For all that, there are a ton of things that don't play nicely on Linux. 3d software, CAD, and thousands of one-offs used in specific industries or companies in terms of both software or specialized hardware  (non-windows one-offs also exist). The future does seem to be getting increasingly agnostic towards OS's as larger companies move towards SAAS/cloud platforms and subscriptions, and games moved towards kits that provide easy cross-platform development to account for the multitude of consoles etc.

"This is my worst fear when it comes to webmail accounts. If I use iCloud/Google/Microsoft/yahoo (shudder) and they cancel my account, not only do I lose all email, pictures and other cloud services associated with that account but I additionally lose access to most all of my other accounts online that require email for two factor or updates to the account. Additionally I can‚Äôt even imagine the implications of using Apple or Googles SSO for these online accounts. I imagine that data is just lost because you don‚Äôt even have a login and password. 

Someday this will all come crashing down in one way or another then hopefully we‚Äôll come up with a better solution than free email and cloud services. 

For instance, Apple cancels my ID. I can‚Äôt login to my phone to pay my car payment through the app that has my creds stored on a recognized device. If that bank is tied to my Apple ID when I go to a new way of accessing the app it will send an email to my icloud address, or a text to my phone I can no longer use. So I‚Äôd have to get a new phone that uses another operating system and either get the code or call the bank and convince them that I no longer have a digital identity and really need to setup a new email without verification but I‚Äôm totally not trying to take over the account fraudulently. 

There may be some inconsistencies but there are a lot of failure points with them being able to ice your account at any time.",1619108015,-1
"No one would be asking the court to rule on whether the police can use tools like Cellebrite. But software used by the police has to be licensed properly. For instance, if the police were using pirated versions of Windows then Microsoft could sue them. 

The threat here is that police departments could be sued directly by Apple for using the software. This legal risk means that the legal and compliance people in those police departments might think twice before buying - hurting Cellebrite's bottom line. In reality, Apple are unlikely to care enough about some freely available iTunes DLLs to publicly sue police departments.

But Apple absolutely might care about a company profiting from the illegal distribution of Apple software in order to compromise the security of Apple devices. So Apple could sue Cellebrite directly, forcing them to stop illegal distribution of the iTunes libraries (which would potentially prevent Cellebrite from accessing Apple devices). If they didn't care enough to do so before Signal raised awareness, they almost have to care now, because if they're seen to do nothing then other companies might decide to distribute Apple software illegally. Suing Cellebrite would be a necessary deterrent.

Of course, it's possible that Cellebrite have made the appropriate license arrangements with Apple and this is all above board. Possible but unlikely.",1619108387,-1

"Google is one of the main players in the war against individual privacy. They aren't the only ones, but they are a huge reason companies like Microsoft decided that their new OS needs to collect data on users.

 People say information is power, and Google and other big tech knows you better than you know yourself. On the surface maybe it doesn't seem so bad, but they will not hesitate to use this information against you. They can target ads to manulipate you wien you are feeling vulnerable, or keep you from learning facts that may change the way you view a political issue because it benefits them or a partner. 

 For example, Google probably does not rank youtube videos discussing the importance of online privacy, or the  negative effects of a few tech giants knowing everything about the populas wile also controlling so much of the information that is presented to the population. Even for people who are strongly for petsonal privacy, this i formation isn't going to be ranked first as they have an agenda to push and a means to push it.",1619113154,1

So you can buy O365 run it for your whole family for 4 years or you can buy 1 license for 1 PC/Mac for $450 and run it as long as it‚Äôs supported.

What the SaaS model has done has cut down on the billions software companies large and small were losing on pirated software. As well as increased revenue past the 3 year mark.

They finally caught on that he wasn't going to get anywhere with me and he said something about ""I know you like to eat at (and he said a restaurant name)"". Given his accent I didn't even process it until he hung up and realized he mentioned the name of a mom+pop restaraunt that I don't go to frequently but did recently (too obscure for anyone to know off hand).  I think I paid in cash, so there was seemingly no way they should know.  The only thing I realized is I had taken pictures since it was some relatives we got together there and I had labeled the name as the folder name on google drive in my account.  It was not shared with anyone and I had dual factor authentication (google authenticator), so unlikely to be hacked.  So I thought I was messing with him, but in the end it was reversed... still wondering how he knew or got access or something.",1619320958,1
"Yeah but 90% of the copies sold to consumers are OEM licenses anyway which means that Microsoft doesn't have to give those customers support as it's supposed to be the responsibility of the OEM. When you buy a retail copy of Windows you are eligible for direct support from Microsoft for the lifetime of the product. It's really important for small business and certain markets. Windows 10 also gets feature updates twice a year.

Saying that you get ""ads"" on Windows 10 is pretty debatable. Yes, a clean install comes with Spotify and a few suggestions like Candy Crush, but if you remove them they go away and never come back. Go into the settings app and start typing the word ""suggestions."" You can turn off Microsoft notifications of all kinds from ""how to use Windows"" to ""you should use One Drive"" to ""check out this app."" There is not one ongoing thing that you can't disable in that regard. If you didn't take the time to figure that out, that's your own fault. 

It's been made clear that Windows 10 is likely the last version as it's moving to a Software as a service model. Considering that retail keys are transferable, it means the each license is effectively a lifetime license and you only have to buy a new one if you want to add another PC to your personal collection without discontinuing an old one. A lifetime license to Windows for 129.99 that includes support directly from Microsoft and an annoying Candy Crush that I have to remove after a clean install is an incredibly miniscule price to pay. You can remove those apps from the start menu, right-click&gt;uninstall. It takes me less than 60 seconds to go through the list and I will repeat, I *never* have to do it again until I reinstall Windows, they even stay gone through major feature updates.

If we consider the ""lifetime license"" aspect due to the new release style, Windows is now cheaper than its ever been too. I don't know how anyone can consider that anti-consumer either.",1619322163,1
"&gt;As for the upgradability, the author complains about things like RAM, CPU, GPU not being replaceable. I would challenge you to find a similar product in which this is the case. I can't find teardowns of all the similar desktops (including those by Lenovo or HP), but on the Microsoft Surface Studio, another slim all-in-one, you can't replace any of those things either.

You mean the teardown for https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Studio+Teardown/74448

With user replaceable hard drive, ssd, Modular SD card slot, Modular power supply. Now I will give you the Ram and CPU are soldered on although the CPU being soldering on is that not odd and not insurmountable silly to replace. The ram is another matter but while nearly impossible to replace its easier than the integrated onto chip than the m1. For 99.99% of shops its a wash either way

From the IFixIt teardown a screen replacement seems extremely easy and not tied to the device either even if a bit expensive. You are correct that we don't have a teardown for the new iMac but we can look at the ipad, iphones, macbooks, and imac minis for guides at how terrible it will be.

&gt;Slim desktops are essentially like laptops these days. Motherboard with everything soldered to it. It's true that the design decision of slim/light dictates this sort of thing, so you could solve the repairability issue by stopping the fight for thinner/lighter, but this is clearly not just an Apple problem. It's not like Apple is making thin/light products and everyone else is making thicker heavier computers in order to preserve easy component access. Apple is the low-hanging fruit and the single biggest (easiest) target for criticisms like this. How much attention do you think this article would get if it complained about Microsoft, Lenovo, HP, etc.?

Most, read every except apple with few exceptions, do not solder ram or ssd or hdd. While the CPU is soldered and most GPUS are on laptops, thats different than what apple is doing here.

As for the slim/light, that is almost entirely apples doing and sadly others are following and yes many both in this thread and just about everyone preaching for right of repair is as well. Apple is also far more than the low hanging fruit as other manufactures (maybe not microsoft) do sell replacement parts and allow upgrades such as the above mentions ram, ssd, hdd of which apple does not. They are pionieering the ways to be anti-consumer",1619325536,1
"As a developer, reading stories like this make me sick. And as a person, it makes me enraged.

Imo, the blame lays it two places:

- Post Office management
- Fujistu management

By not having a human in the mix, looking at the reports and asking questions, the Post Office have said that they care about processes more than people. And they have implied that they believe software cannot be wrong - [Therac-25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25) would like a word.

By also not even thinking of reporting potential bugs, they are at fault. If you think there's a bug with the software, you should always report it to someone. That bug you found might be inconvenient to you, but it might also be deadly to someone else.

Fujitsu are to blame because they shipped buggy software. All software will have bugs, but bugs in the basic functionality of the software should have been dealt with as soon as possible. Its an accepted maxim that the further from a programmers finger tips a bug is found, the more expense be it will be to fix. Thus is why we also write tests.

---

For non devs: we write code which is designed to test the code that we write. We do thus by providing known inputs and expecting certain outputs. If we don't get the expected output, then the code fails and is not completed.

As an trivial sounding example, say you were writing a calculator, you would need to create tests which assure that the addition function worked correctly. So, you would write a number of tests (the number is up for debate, so we won't go into that) which test either the functionality or the behaviour (in the domain of testing, these can mean slightly different things) of the addition function.

So you'd go and write a test which makes sure that 1 + 1 = 2. But is that enough? What about negative numbers? What about decimal numbers? What about [imaginary numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number).

Only when they open sourced it, did Microsoft find and fix several bugs with the Windows calculator. Proving that testing is non trivial.

(Leaving potential comments about Microsoft's code quality to one side)

---

In a lot of software houses, the expectation is that you will ""move fast and break things,"" as you go. The problem with this is that a lot of developers take that to mean, ""move fast, break things, and don't write tests because they slow you down."" I'm assuming a lot here, but my thought is that the devs didn't write sufficient tests fir their code (if any) in this instance _because_ they were under the delusion that it slows you down. But to quote ""Uncle"" Bob Martin (a well respected programmer, one if the authors of the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), and supporter of ""clean code""):

&gt; The only way to move fast is to move clean

By "" clean"" he means ""with lots of tests.""

(As a note: I don't agree with Bob's politics, but his points about software development are backed by 50+ years of experience)

The theory is, and it's backed by  studies, that a code base with sufficiently high code coverage (the number of lines of code covered by tests as a percentage of the size of the overall code base) will have fewer bugs, be easier to maintain, and cost less than a code base with low or no code coverage.

Why didn't they write tests? Most of the time its either poor education in the part of the developer (in order to write code which is testable, you need to wrote code in a specific way), or its down to pressure from above in the form of ""we don't have time to write tests."" Educating developers is easy, but the argument from management is insidious.

Would you drive a car which hadn't been tested for safety? Would you eat food which hadn't been tested by the authorities? Would you willing board a passenger flight if the pilot hadn't taken any exams or qualifications? No, you wouldn't do any of these things.

Us devs now control the world. Governments and policy makers think that they do, but we are the ones who write the software which implements those policies. We are an incredibly young industry, at around 70 years old at a push (assuming that you count [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) as one of the first true programmers. Yet we don't have a code of ethics, or the equivalent of a Hippocratic oath (at least, a widely accepted and practised one, taught at schools).

By not building software with testing in mind, or with compassion for our users, we are doomed to fail, and people will die. And by not pushing back when management or customers/clients call for no testing, developers are just as culpable as anyone rise in the chain. With the one exception that the developers will be blamed, they will be fired, and will find it harder to find work - ""I can see that you worked for [Volkswagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal) and left right around the time of the emissions scandal. What did you work on there?"". In fact, the CEO of Volkwagen actually blamed, "" some developer"" for cheating the emissions test rather than whoever was actually to blame - there is no way that a developer had made that decision.

This is not an endorsement of Test-driven Development, Behaviour-driven Development, and other methodology or technology. But rather an attempt at stating its importance in modern development.",1619338847,-1

**While the US leads in tech, Brussels is setting the standards for online privacy and regulating AI**

The Americans innovate and the Europeans regulate. That was a simple way of explaining the interaction between government and the technology business. It is still broadly true. The European Union is not quite an innovation desert but nothing rivals Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook or Microsoft. The US has flubbed questions such as internet privacy, whereas the EU is a rule-making superpower. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of 2018 has become, in effect, a global standard.

Now the EU is flexing its muscles again, issuing proposed regulations on the hottest topic in digital governance: artificial intelligence, or AI. That is well overdue. Computer decision-making can determine whether you get a job, a loan, a home or a date, as well as what news or ads appear on your screen. The software that makes these decisions is almost impenetrable. It is ‚Äútrained‚Äù on databases that may have serious flaws. If computers learn to make decisions based on information about young white men, say, they may botch choices involving women, older people or those with different skin colour.

Proposals for ethical AI abound but so far only the EU is trying to codify in law principles such as fairness and transparency. The result is far from perfect. Its 100-page white paper is replete with exceptions. A few things are banned outright, such as what it calls ‚Äúsubliminal‚Äù manipulation of individual decision-making. Facial recognition is tightly regulated (finding missing children is fine; Chinese-style population surveillance isn‚Äôt). Penalties are hefty: up to 6 per cent of a violator‚Äôs global revenues.

Lobbying over the details in the coming years will be intense. All that time and energy will underline the EU‚Äôs importance as the global rule-setter. It will also highlight the costs of the legislative vacuum in Washington. When American lawmakers decided ten years ago that internet privacy was none of their business, they in effect handed power to Brussels.

They are either buying off-the-shelf software made by whoever is accepted as the ""industry standard"" or paying for contractors from consulting firms to do the ""one time work"".

No one is invested in the outcome personally, and none of them care about the user experience.

I see this at my own company. I am part of a small ""elite"" team that handles some of our most important efforts - so we are an exception, but by and large the rest of the company, most software development is outsourced to the ""best bidder"", and then invariably, when you want to enhance said software, you have to outsource again, and the people who work on it are not the people who created it.",1619467572,1

"Tile is not arguing that Apple stole their idea, but that Apple's allowing an integration with iOS in Tile they wouldn't allow for external services. And that is an anti-trust case. Just like Windows had it's ""secret APIs"" that only Microsoft products used, which was part of the argument against IE. The fact that they're different isn't a safety net, it could even make things worse, if the AirTag does something that Tile simply cannot.

This is not clearly the case of Apple replacing a bloated over-engineered solution with a simple, included, basic and good-enough solution. If it is then that's great. If it isn't though, Apple will have to open APIs to allow competing products to do interesting decisions that Apple didn't, helping both companies make a better product (just like a lot of Android innovation ended up in the iPhone).",1619483638,1
"I was thinking more of the PR and maybe legal department (not sure if they'd care) which have to have reviewed this in a company like Microsoft.

"&gt; Anytime a company (Apple, Microsoft, Linux, etc) releases a new OS,. there's 100's and 100's of improvements, security-fixes and new features ""under the hood"". You may not see 90% of them,.. but those things ""under the hood"" are definitely still helping you.

Firstly, Linux is not a company. It is non-profit and run by the community (which includes corporations who utilise it). 

Secondly, Linux does not really release a new OS like Apple or Microsoft, only new versions of the same kernel which can be continuously upgraded. The kernel is the basis for the OS. Linux itself‚Ä¶ isn't really actually an operating system, but a family of operating systems which use the same kernel. 

Thirdly, Linux has no trouble running on decades old hardware. Unlike the Mac OS or Windows, it can be stripped down to still run the same on extremely old hardware. Linux did not drop the 386 processors [until 21 years later in 2012](https://www.zdnet.com/article/good-bye-386-linux-to-drop-support-for-i386-chips-with-next-major-release/), and even then, this is because there was so little demand nobody at all stepped up to maintain it. It still supports the 486 processor, if I recall correctly, which is over 31 years old. Linux is a great example of how one can still see software improvements even on extremely old hardware. This isn't really a counterpoint, but worth mentioning in this context. 

Pedantry aside, Linux is‚Ä¶ actually a pretty good example of under-the-hood improvements. Since the Linux kernel is an under-the-hood thing itself‚Ä¶ every improvement to it is under the hood. 

&gt; &gt; Also recent hardware and software updates not bringing that much big of improvement or change...
&gt;
&gt; That's just not true though. If you look at iPhones for example.. in the roughly 10 years that iPhones have been around,. they're demonstrably different (and more ""feature-rich"") than when they were 1st introduced.

I think they are talking about the past 5 years, not past 10 years. I likely would not have much trouble using Android 4.4 if not for software compatibility. In fact, lately it seems Android updates have been making the OS worse rather than better so much so it would almost be preferable‚Ä¶ if not for the very important compatibility and even more important security concerns. So, I guess that also counts as under-the-hood improvements. 

My phone is from 2014 (still gets updates to the latest Android versions though via LineageOS) and is only lately getting slow, mostly from badly-written software and perhaps a few too many background apps. Better-written software, like RedReader, runs great as always. And my computer uses processors from 2009 and runs quite well. 

Improvements get increasingly visible after 5 or 10 years, so they do exist‚Ä¶ but a 2 year update cycle, in my opinion, is quite excessive. Things should be built to last, and hardware upgrades should be something for improving speed, not something users are forced into by planned obsolescence or increasingly badly-written software.",1619495101,1
"100% agree on all your Linux points (and I'm glad someone brought that up / pointed it out). But it really only goes further to cement/illustrate the points I'm trying to make. 

There's a lot of choices out there. Different people with different priorities or preferences should all be able to make different choices. 

* If Neighbor in 1 house over is a diehard open-source/linux guy,. Great!.. there's already an almost infinite swath of solutions and hardware that he can choose from. 

* If Neighbor 2 houses down prefers to have all Apple gear,.. Great!.. that company or those products works for them,. shouldn't they be free to choose that ?

* if Neighbor 3 houses down is a career Microsoft fan (Xbox and Zune and everything).. Great!.. shouldn't that person also be free to choose whatever works for them ?


&gt; but a 2 year update cycle, in my opinion, is quite excessive.

But that's not a thing. There's no Law of Physics that requires people to ""upgrade all their devices on an exact 2 year schedule"". People individually CHOOSE to do that,. but that's just a choice they make,.. it's not a requirement. Nobody is going to die if they hold out for 3 years. or 3.5 years. Or 5 years or whatever. 

I just don't see the problem here. If you walk by a random person on the street.. why the F do you care what products (or what replacement cycle) they arrived at (due to their own preferences or needs) ?.. Why is that even your place to judge or critique ?.. they're standing right in front of you in the coffee-shop line and they pull out an iPhone 12,.. do you just immediately assume ""they're stupid and wasted money on a thing they don't need"".. ?.. Why?. .You don't even know them (or how they arrived at their decision to buy that produce). 

I just don't get the rampant judgementalism. Why not just let people buy what they want to buy. It's their decision. Not yours. If someone wants a Ultrathin MacBook Air that You think is ""harder to repair"",.. why does your opinion even matter in their purchasing-choice?. They're buying the product for themselves, not to satisfy you.",1619496451,1
"&gt; 100% agree on all your Linux points (and I'm glad someone brought that up / pointed it out). But it really only goes further to cement/illustrate the points I'm trying to make. 

Good to know. Also‚Ä¶ I did allude to it not actually really disagreeing with the core points in my last couple sentences. That is why I called it pedantry. That part was a correction, but only for the details rather than the comment as a whole. I was (and am) a bit tired, so may not have conveyed that too clearly. 

&gt; There's a lot of choices out there. Different people with different priorities or preferences should all be able to make different choices. 
&gt;
&gt;* If Neighbor in 1 house over is a diehard open-source/linux guy,. Great!.. there's already an almost infinite swath of solutions and hardware that he can choose from.

&gt;
&gt;* if Neighbor 3 houses down is a career Microsoft fan (Xbox and Zune and everything).. Great!.. shouldn't that person also be free to choose whatever works for them ?

I agree. I lean libertarian. I think people should vote with their wallet against planned obsolescence, but I support people's right to choose otherwise. Choice is how we opt out of exploitive products today. I would hate to see that taken away. 

&gt; But that's not a thing. There's no Law of Physics that requires people to ""upgrade all their devices on an exact 2 year schedule"". People individually CHOOSE to do that,. but that's just a choice they make,.. it's not a requirement. Nobody is going to die if they hold out for 3 years. or 3.5 years. Or 5 years or whatever. 

The 2 year upgrade cycle is a function of: 

1. People's expectation that this is how long a device should last. 

2. Manufacturers only providing software updates for this long, restricting people's ability to go beyond this by using locked bootloaders, and designing hardware in a repair-hostile way. 

The second behaviour is the behaviour I oppose, and encourage people to avoid by buying from companies who do not engage in it. 

&gt; I just don't see the problem here. If you walk by a random person on the street.. why the F do you care what products (or what replacement cycle) they arrived at (due to their own preferences or needs) 

Excessive upgrades exacerbate climate change and environmental damage, and if I make people aware of alternatives this may also help them by allowing them to get more reliable technology that will still work even if they can't upgrade and save money. 

&gt; Why is that even your place to judge or critique ?..

Climate change threatens huge amounts of death and catastrophe in the future. I would even say it threatens human extinction, if humans weren't so adaptable to surviving even in the most hostile environments. I think this threat is enough to make avoiding as much as possible a worthy goal. Plus, again, it can be helpful to individuals to have more reliable technology and save money. I won't force it on anyone, but want to encourage it as much as possible. 

&gt; they're standing right in front of you in the coffee-shop line and they pull out an iPhone 12,.. do you just immediately assume ""they're stupid and wasted money on a thing they don't need""..

No, of course not. Maybe they just upgraded from an ancient broken phone. Or, maybe they have some compelling reason to upgrade more frequently, that they have while others do not. Individual variation makes imposing one set of judgement on everybody very impractical. Plus, I don't like judging people; it is stressful and creates bad vibes. Instead, I focus on how to improve for the future. What is done, is done. All we can do is try to improve what happens next. 

&gt; . .You don't even know them (or how they arrived at their decision to buy that produce). 

I agree, and just explained the exact same point before reading this sentence‚Ä¶ Sometime maybe I should try reading the entire comment before responding to it point by point‚Ä¶ 

&gt; I just don't get the rampant judgementalism. 

Yeah, I really dislike judgementalism. I prefer to focus on improvement, not shaming. Shaming is horrible and unproductive and often makes people really unwilling to change their minds! Sometimes it is effective, if someone is already leaning towards agreeing with a point (as was the case for me with veganism), but more often than not, it just turns people off of the cause. 

&gt; Why not just let people buy what they want to buy. It's their decision. Not yours. 

I agree. My goal is to change or at least inform their decision as much as I can, not to force anything on anyone. Although forcing it could currently be justified for environmental reasons‚Ä¶ forcing it on everyone would have the problem of not accounting for exceptions to the rule. 

&gt; why does your opinion even matter in their purchasing-choice?.

My points are getting redundant at this point due to responding point-by-point instead of to the entire thing, but since I've already kept the format until basically to the end‚Ä¶ 

Because climate change is extremely important to mitigate, because it helps people not lose access to their technology if they are unable to buy upgrades, because it can help them save money, and because it means better technology on the used market. The latter 3 points, being reason to help people get a more informed opinion (they may not care about these advantages; it is their choice), and the first point being reason to actually try to convince them of it rather than just inform because it is important for the future survival of everyone to mitigate climate change as much as we possibly can.",1619499608,1

"We are an international headhunter company, your profile attracted me,‚Äô began the remarkable message I received on LinkedIn. My newfound interlocutor, ‚ÄòMr Zha‚Äô, explained in broken English that, ‚Äòone of our partner in China looking for a freelancer researcher, helping them write some papers they will pay 1500-3000 USD for 6-10 pages. Contact me if you are interested. I can send you the [job description].‚Äô

To many such an approach might seem inconspicuous and hardly worth mentioning. After all, isn‚Äôt this precisely the sort of engagement that LinkedIn is designed for?  But when you work for a foreign policy think tank, business offers like these are highly unusual: our work is corporate and side-contracts are rare; the pay was three times the market rate; and the poor English was atypical ‚Äì to say the least ‚Äì of any reputable approach.

So unusual was this message, that I immediately remarked on it to a colleague, only to hear that he too had received the same message. After further enquiries, it transpired that alongside myself, messages were received by our executive director, then-research director and ‚Äì perhaps most tellingly, our Asia studies director. A curious colleague replied and was sent the job description. In it, Mr Zha promised easy work that, once completed, would be followed by what he euphemistically described ‚Äòa long-term cooperation for years‚Äô.

He went on to clarify that ‚Äòa face-to-face Interview in China‚Äô would be required but not to fear as the ‚Äòcompany will pay the travel fee including air tickets, hotel, meals, and other related‚Äô costs. A fee of $3,000 and an all-expenses-paid trip to China for a couple of days‚Äô work was beginning to sound too good to be true. And indeed it was.

It transpired Mr Zha was a state-sponsored Chinese recruiter tasked with identifying and recruiting Western academics into an exercise designed to turn, compromise, or denigrate Beijing‚Äôs critics. One senior security source with personal experience of conducting such operations described it as ‚Äòa shoddily executed attempt at every intelligence agency‚Äôs textbook method for compromising academics.‚Äô

We reported the incident to the security services via channels and ignored our would-be interlocutor‚Äôs messages. But it seems that we were far from alone. For this week, it was reported that MI5 has recorded over 10,000 such examples of recruitment on LinkedIn over the past decade. In September 2020, the Daily Telegraph exposed the Zhenhua database, which Beijing uses to compile information on targets for Chinese intelligence activities.

Nobody at the Henry Jackson Society was remotely surprised to see that we were repeatedly mentioned in it. As one of the Chinese Government‚Äôs most vocal critics, we knew why we ‚Äì more than any other think tank ‚Äì were the foremost target of China‚Äôs attention in London. If all of China‚Äôs influence efforts were as futile as Mr Zha‚Äôs message, it would warrant little attention. But the truth is that this message was just the tip of the iceberg of the infiltration and disruption China unleashes on those who seek to challenge it about its repression abroad and at home.

The methods that Beijing has deployed against us are worth recounting. In recent years, we have been warned by Microsoft of state-directed hacking attempts on our email server, had a number of laptops stolen in suspect circumstances, seen our website face thousands of ‚Äòbrute force‚Äô hacking attempts while our events in Parliament have been repeatedly crashed by Chinese ‚Äòdiplomats‚Äô, who, in turn, have summoned us for formal rebukes for our ‚Äòunreliable, discreditable, and unhelpful research.‚Äô

While such disruption is nothing compared to the persecution the Chinese Communist Party directs at its own people, it is nonetheless tiresome. It is also an affront to our own democratic debate that a foreign state is able to meddle with think-tanks and campaigners without response from our government.  As yet, however, there is no state support for the targets of such state meddling. In truth, while all of us would know who to call if we were the victim of crime, none of us know who turn when we are the victims of foreign meddling.

This situation cannot continue, especially as these malign practices are growing at an alarming pace. Although we are opponents of just about every hostile state, including Russia and Iran, none has attempted anything remotely comparable to China‚Äôs intimidation campaign.

If China‚Äôs actions at home are anything to go by, the frequency of attempts at interference is likely to increase. Just as Hong Kong‚Äôs increased democratic opposition to the Communist Party preceded an assault on its freedoms, we can expect the same here. The history of communist states teaches us that, as China‚Äôs repressive apparatus is ever more emboldened at home, it will look outwards to wield its might abroad

So far, there is little to suggest the UK is ready to openly acknowledge, let alone face this threat. With the Security Service spending just 13 per cent of its budget on protecting its own citizens from foreign intelligence operations, it‚Äôs not clear that it would be able to act even if ministers were to commit to seriously tackling China.

In the meantime, those targeted by Chinese disruption will be left to defend themselves from China‚Äôs threats and enticing offers. Let us hope they are all as unconvincing as Mr Zha.",1619604818,-1

"The basic rule of thumb according to a labor lawyer I spoke to in 2018 (California) is that if you go there regularly (basically multiple days a week, for several hours a day) and do the same job every time, you‚Äôre basically an employee. People like plumbers or even maid services wouldn‚Äôt be considered employees even though they may serve the same place often and perform the same job. They‚Äôre running their own business as a contractor essentially and the company using their services is paying them for a specific service, unrelated to the goal of the company. For instance, janitorial or trash services would not be directly supporting the goal of manufacturing and sale of batteries, as engineers or accountants would. 

In contrast, Uber, Lyft, etc workers are literally carrying out the operations of the company. Corporate Uber is nothing without the drivers. Since they are so critical to the function of the business, they should be considered employees.

Your thought about twitch streamers is interesting. I would consider them to be self-employee using twitch as a platform for their product, which is their entertainment value of course. It could easily be argued that they should be paying twitch to use the platform since it is how they generate income. In that way it is a business tool as much as Microsoft office suite is. Of course they take some of the ad revenue so in a way the streamers who make income are giving a cut to the platform.

What I don‚Äôt understand is why can‚Äôt these companies just classify people who work regular hours per day, for 40+ hours per week as employees and the ones who drive irregular hours or part time as contractors or part timers? It‚Äôs pretty difficult to get an Uber right now in a densely populated area in California, ever since this rule came into effect. Nobody wants to drive anymore. They‚Äôd probably be better off hiring core employees and utilizing contract work for people who just want to drive Friday and Saturday nights.",1619754539,1

That frustration spilled onto social media last week: ""Spoken to quite a few colleagues at Google that say they'll quit if forced to go back to the office in September,"" Google Cloud programmer Chris Broadfoot¬†[tweeted on Thursday](https://twitter.com/broady/status/1385337756939800577). Several other employees joined the thread to co-sign the message, some saying they may look for another job if Google makes them go back to the office.

A half-dozen current Google employees who spoke to Insider shared a similar sentiment or said they knew colleagues who had made permanent moves during the pandemic. They asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak to the press.

""A lot of my colleagues have moved away with no real intention of coming back,"" one of those employees said. ""Especially in that 30s/40s-age bracket. I would say that's predominantly where it is.""

That same employee told Insider they had handed in their notice after their request to work in a location outside of the Bay Area was shot down by their manager.

Another current employee said that at least two VPs in their group had made permanent moves during the pandemic, and they expected they would not return to the office if it became required.

Google has told employees they are expected back in offices by September 2021, but the company said last December that it will pilot a new flexible arrangement where employees

Google has told employees they are expected back in offices by September 2021, but the company said last December that it will pilot a new flexible arrangement where employees are expected to work from the office three days a week.¬†

Since then, Google has offered few specifics of the new arrangement, and employees are pressing leadership for answers. Google has never said it would offer fully remote work for anyone who wants it, but as the deadline to return to offices has been pushed back, some employees have relocated anyway, gambling that Google will eventually follow other companies that are allowing employees to work from home permanently. Facebook announced last year that it would begin allowing employees to request to remotely full time.

""There are employees leaving already because they don't want to wait around until September. They want to get on with their lives,"" one employee said.

A Google spokesperson said the company will experiment with a series of pilots around remote work, but said nothing had changed in terms of the existing policy.

Google wants to be flexible. Employees want to know how flexible.

To be sure, plenty of Google employees do want to return to offices, if the company's own polling is to be believed. In an internal survey conducted last year, 62% of Googlers said they wanted to return to the office, although just 8% said they would want to do so full time.

Over the past few months, CEO Sundar Pichai has made other hints that Google is considering a flexible setup when employees return. Since then, questions about remote work have been continually put to leadership, according to employees and internal materials viewed by Insider.

""Almost every TGIF [Thank God Its Friday] or area all hands, the question gets asked,"" one employee said.

In one all-hands held last October, which was viewed by Insider, Pichai said he saw the majority of Googlers' roles still tied to an office, but said the company planned to expand the number of ""hub"" offices in order to give employees more flexibility.

""And beyond that, we are also thinking, what does hybrid-flexible work mean in that context?"" he added.

Since then, employees have pressed leadership to elaborate on just how flexible Google is willing to be and whether the three-day office rule will be applied evenly across the company, but say they're not getting answers.

""Because there's like no clear guidance and like more hand-wavy communication, we're all sort of guessing what to do,"" said one current employee.

Google, with its open office culture filled with perks like snacks and nap pods, has plenty of reasons to cling onto in-person work. One employee pointed out that splitting teams between office and remote work could create awkward dynamics. Google has also continued to invest in physical workspaces during the pandemic, expanding its Mountain View, California, headquarters, with plans for a new campus in San Jose.

On the company's Q1 earnings call this week, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said that Alphabet intends to spend $7 billion in offices and data centers in 2021.¬† ""We do value bringing people together in the office,"" she told one analyst on the call. ""And we're looking at a hybrid work-from-home/work-from-office model.""

But as they wait for answers on what that will look like, some employees have taken the plunge and moved away from their offices, while some others don't see the need to go into the office even three days a week.

""I have no intentions of going back to Seattle every day so I can scurry from tiny room to tiny room on GVC calls,"" tweeted Justin Beckworth, a Google engineering manager. ""Right now I'm managing people in 8 cities spread across 5 time zones. What possible reason do I have to be in an office?""

**Accelerating revenue and profits suggest an enduring effect from shift to digital during pandemic**

After the world‚Äôs largest tech companies enjoyed a boom during the coronavirus pandemic, the expectation was that life would gradually return to normal.

It certainly is not turning out that way.

Big Tech this week reported a surge in growth and profits that stunned Wall Street, delivering powerful evidence that the digital dependence forced on a large part of the world‚Äôs population over the past year could have an enduring effect.

The outsized figures amount to a reset in the business world, some tech investors and analysts said. According to this view, the leading digital powers have consolidated their gains from the past 12 months and made themselves an even more indispensable part of work and personal life.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been an unbelievable tech reporting season for the biggest of the big,‚Äù said Jim Tierney, a fund manager at AllianceBernstein.

Big Tech‚Äôs increasingly outsized impact on the world of business can best be summed up by just two numbers.

One is the combined revenue of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft, which jumped 41 per cent in the first three months of this year, to $322bn. That points to a rapid acceleration in growth that the leading tech companies have not seen in years, even as they have become some of the world‚Äôs biggest companies.

The other is the companies‚Äô profit growth, which has been even more spectacular. After-tax earnings for the five soared by 105 per cent from the previous year, to $75bn. Profit margins rose strongly across the sector, as the biggest companies benefited from the economics of scale while keeping a wary eye on cost expansion during the pandemic.",1619798370,1
"[3]

The stellar first-quarter performance can be traced clearly in a handful of areas. Digital advertising, which has been making steady inroads into traditional forms of commercial messaging for years, has jumped sharply.

The most widely-used mobile and cloud computing platforms, from the iPhone to Amazon‚Äôs cloud services, have seen a new burst of activity. And some leading tech companies have capitalised on the extensive use of their platforms to mount an incursion into a wider range of highly profitable services.

‚ÄúPre-pandemic, we were seeing a deceleration in digital advertising growth ‚Äî but the pandemic has juggled a lot of things,‚Äù said Wieser. Brand owners developed a new appreciation of digital advertising during the pandemic as they became more reliant on online sales, he added, while the many new businesses formed over the past year have turned naturally to online channels to find a market.

Google and Facebook each registered their strongest advertising growth for years, with Google‚Äôs ad revenue increasing 32 per cent and Facebook‚Äôs leaping 46 per cent. The leaps come against a recovering backdrop for global advertising markets ‚Äî though they far outpace the 10 per cent rebound expected for the industry at large this year, according to GroupM.

The time and money consumers are now willing to lavish on their most important gadgets, meanwhile, was seen in a 66 per cent leap in Apple‚Äôs revenue from the sale of iPhones. Even the market for PCs, which had been in decline, saw a strong rebound, with unit sales leaping by around a third in the first quarter, raising earnings at Microsoft.

By comparison, the steady expansion of the cloud computing platforms run by Amazon, Microsoft and Google, which have become a mainstay of corporate IT departments, have made fewer headlines. But the rise of remote work, learning and entertainment enabled all three cloud operators to maintain the growth rates they were recording this time last year ‚Äî even as they become much larger, and as some of their customers were hard hit during the pandemic.",1619798439,1
"[4]

Meanwhile, the tech companies have taken advantage of their deep ties with millions of users to extend their reach deeper into some of the services delivered over their platforms. Apple‚Äôs move into services, once disdained by Wall Street as an uninteresting sideline to its gadgets, contributed to a profit jump that lifted its gross profit margin to more than 42 per cent ‚Äî a breakout from the level of around 38 per cent that had held over many quarters.

At Amazon, meanwhile, newer services have brought a transformation in the company‚Äôs profit profile. That includes the growth of the Amazon Web Services cloud platform, as well as advertising ‚Äî as seen in a 73 per cent leap in the company‚Äôs ‚Äúother revenue‚Äù category, which consists mainly of ads, in the first quarter.

The result was a record quarterly profit for a company once notorious for its persistent losses. Amazon‚Äôs $8.1bn in after-tax earnings in the quarter was equivalent to the company‚Äôs net earnings in its entire first 22 years of existence.

Amid the euphoria on Wall Street, concerns about potential intervention by regulators to curb the power ‚Äî and profits ‚Äî of Big Tech were briefly forgotten. Shares in all but Apple were at or very close to all-time highs in the wake of the latest figures.

There were few other worries to spoil the party. An end to the strong secular growth trends that have lifted Big Tech could loom before too many years, said Tierney. But he added: ‚ÄúHow many years can Microsoft grow 50 per cent in the cloud business, and how many years can Google‚Äôs advertising keep growing at 30 per cent? There‚Äôs no sign of them hitting the wall yet.‚Äù",1619798476,1
"I really like working from home. Saves me hours of commute time, the housing is cheaper and I put in longer hours of work (because I want to) resulting in higher individual productivity. I strongly recognize the benefits of working from home over commute to office. However, my organization noticed that while working from home has upped individual productivity, it is decimating group productivity of high performing, loosely coupled teams. Minimal impact to teams with highly structured processes. Does this means that the loosely coupled teams should move to highly structured processes to reduce impact? We tried that and it only exacerbated the problem. That is because high performing individuals struggle to perform at their peak performance in rigid process structures. Assuming those at Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, etc are generally considered high performance individuals, I can see how the working from home culture might have affected group performance. 

These companies mostly make data oriented decisions. Google, like my org, must have noticed the performance numbers change for the worse for these high performance teams. I am not a fan of long commutes or exorbitant home prices but the data is starting to show deterioration in group performance and interpersonal relationships due to remote working. If you‚Äôve noticed people have got edgier at work, lot of it is due to the raging pandemic that is tearing families apart. A small portion of it is due to lack of face-to-face communication. Video calls aren‚Äôt cutting it.",1619798969,-1
"Probably the best way to revitalize small towns and reverse the brain drain to the coasts they've felt over the last few decades is to ensure good rural broadband access and then that companies like Google and Microsoft have to pay something like 3/4 to remote workers what they pay to someone working in their main office.

In rural NM your standard of living would actually be *higher* than what you get in SF under those conditions. Hell, in rural CA you'd still probably be sitting pretty. You could live like royalty in the Midwest or Appalachia.",1619800759,1

&gt; Also, it's silly to suggest that 7% of revenue saved would be anything less than incredible. Saving even .5% at most companies of similar size is pretty much unheard of.

Google employees are expected to return to offices in September.
Some employees aren't happy about the idea. Others want details on the new hybrid plans.
One employee told Insider they had quit because Google wasn't permitting a fully remote policy.
